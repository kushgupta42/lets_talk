And what's its impact on the global level? Let's uncover it in today's video From some time I am trying to understand the conflict between Israel Palestine From which, I got some key insights And in today's video, I have to share these important things with you And by the end of this video, you  will also come to know That, how will this impact Bharat This video is going to be different than our other videos But, the purpose of this video is that Instead of surface level information You must get detailed contextual information So that you understand the background You  get a perspective And then, you are able to form your own opinions Your opinions may be different from mine And I respect that Whatever you think about this topic Do tell us about it in the comments Let's start with the video And first let's understand, What  is Hamas? Today, Israel and Palestine looks like this This map in itself is very controversial Because the people of Palestine believe that From 1947 till today Israel is slowly capturing Palestine You can see Palestine's map reducing slowly And this is used by many terror outfits to attack on Israel Is a map justified, to kill innocent people? This is Gaza strip Which shares its borders with Israel and Egypt To its west is Mediterranean sea And this area is controlled by Hamas Hamas is a militant organization Which controls the Gaza strip from 2006 Hamas is a terrorist organization And there is no controversy about it The  United States, European Union and many other countries have designated them as a terrorist organization Hamas means, \"Islamic Resistance Movement\" Hamas was started in 1987 And in 1988 they started a Hamas charter Their objective is to save Palestine from Israeli occupation And not only this  Palestine part The whole of Israel is also included in it In Arabic this word means bravery In Hebrew it loosely means violence To be clear, Hamas wants to remove Israel completely from the map And from the past 30 years, their violent attempts are going on From  1980's to today Let's have a look at all their terror attacks For general public, data of at least 87 attacks is available In total, more than 1000 people have been injured or killed due to the attacks by Hamas Just think about it, This is such  a small country But all the people from this country live under the threat of terror Hence, Israel has made its Iron Dome Defense System What is this Iron Dome? In 2011, Israel Aerospace Industries made a mobile air defense system named Iron Dome The objective of which is, To intercept short range missiles mid-air. Before they do any harm on the ground, destroy them mid-air There are 3 main components of this system Radar system, command system and missile launcher Whenever rockets are launched from Gaza strip Then , this systems detects them and maps their trajectory Then counter missiles  are sent due to which these missiles coming from Gaza are intercepted mid-air & stopped In 2012, the war which happened in 2012", "doc_id": "0 - 299.159", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fe2e56663d3f6232514283eb6f04c96db073449b728cda359a7d58716fb61557", "extra_info": null, "node_info": null, "relationships": {}, "__type__": "1"}, "299.159 - 595.56": {"text": "and saved lives This system is Israel's biggest defense against Hamas Which Hamas also still knows  they launched 5000 rockets This is not some ordinary terror attack This is the declaration of war And this day was also very special Because around this day only 50 years ago too, Israel was attacked The depth of this attack, its importance And for understanding its impact  on future We need to know some its history This attack reminds of the 1973 Yom Kippur War The fight then was not with any terror outfit But with Israel's surrounding arab countries Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on 6th Oct, 1973 This day was special because this day  was a Jewish Holy day \"Yom Kippur\" On this day Jewish people follow a 2000 year old tradition They celebrate it by drinking wine But don't say cheers to each other Instead they say this It's english translation is Next year we will be together in  Jerusalem The attack happening on this day was a message for them For this war, Arab countries had support of Soviet Russia And to balance out this power America supported Israel Historically, America has been doing this America tries to create a counter balance in every war Israel  won this war, but at a high cost More than 2600 soldiers lost their lives And 12000 people were injured From 1948 to today, Israel has fought these many wars You can pause the video and read these names But the war of 1973 was a special one Because Arab countries came to know That it is possible to defeat If Israel didn't have America's support they may be the result would have been different Let's come back to the present This operation of Hamas is named Al Aqsa Storm Let us know about \"Al  Aqsa\" This is Jerusalem One of the holiest places in the world In Judaism, Islam and Chritianity, this has an important place Hamas claims Israeli armed forces does violence around Al Aqsa Mosque Israel did many raids in West Bank this year And more than 200 people  died in this It is important to understand, who were these 200 people Israel believes these 200 people were militants or colleagues of militants Whenever Israel goes inside West Bank for taking action against militants They have to encounter stone pelting Israel says that lives are lost in retaliation While Palestinians say that What work does Israel have in West Bank? The situation has always been complicated As a result, this year more than 200 people were killed in West Bank more than 30 people were killed in Israel The argument here is always that who started the violence? Israel says that people throw stones first And then go into the mosque to hide And Palestinians say that they get into the mosque take people out and kill them Whom to believe?, you yourself can decide it You are smart and make your informed opinions by yourself All these facts are publicly available You can do your research and verify them too I believe that in today's age Everyone must do their own research One must not believe anyone not even on me Everyone must make their own opinions But out of this whole situation, some  questions are raised You see, Gaza strip is surrounded from all sides They can't get help from Israel Then only two options are there Either Egypt is helping them or someone else These 5000 rockets, so many weapons how are they reaching them? The truth is that, On humanitarian grounds America keeps giving them aid But may be this aid money is not reaching to the right people They are used to buy weapons Instead of reducing the conflict in this area The conflict is increasing In the end, it is  important to understand that How will this impact India? To understand this, one need to revisit our last month's G20 video G20 summit was an important event of this year We have made a dedicated video about it Where we talk about the India-Middle East corridor Even Israel's leadership believes that This, is our largest  cooperation project in history Not only at Bharat's level But on global level But it may happen that, after this attack by Hamas This project is canceled Because this route looks something like this And it travels through the Mediterranean Sea For the next few years, if this  area is in conflict Then starting any major project would be difficult here No big country would invest here And even if the route is made Then still it won't be safe for trade Plus, Saudi Arabia now falls in a tricky situation Because, historically they  have supported Palestine And now slowly they had started building connections with Israel Now, whom will they support? Israel or Palestine? Any action of them will hurt the relations from somewhere Such a big attack forces world leaders to comment on it And Saudi Arabia's stance will be very important for Bharat If you want to know about it, Then, the World Affairs channel has an interesting video by  Prashant Dhawan sir I would highly recommend you to watch that video Israel is such a country which never tolerates any type of instigation Never holds back from taking action", "doc_id": "299.159 - 595.56", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "696c29c2d1833b890c970e32bc5260096e0391d0908cf63bb55894132dfd62a2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": null, "relationships": {}, "__type__": "1"}, "595.56 - 721.079": {"text": "Israel's opposition leader as well has supported the  Govt. When it is about National Security Then politics must never come in the middle This must be learned by Bharat's leaders In the end, it is important to understand this That war, is a very dangerous situation Some months ago we were talking to an Indian Jew He  often keeps traveling to Israel He was saying that missile attacks have become quite common Whenever missile attacks happen then sirens start ringing And then they have to leave all the work and get into bunkers For Israeli people War-like situation has become very common And this is  very sad After hearing about such things We understand, how lucky we are that we are away from the war In this whole situation, there are no two sides Nothing can justify, 5000 rockets being fired This is a very big terror attack Because, whenever these  rockets will hit a building Then, they won't ask for their religion And what's your political ideology They will only take lives A rocket indiscriminately targets a kid to an elder Terror cannot be justified Not in Israel, not in India, nowhere in the world And that's why no matter what happens On this channel we won't support any terror outfuit even this much We will always condemn violence And will never support a war War is dangerous for all Bbecause a war, impacts economy too It impacts our day to day  lives as well Supply chains are broken, things become expensive Shortages are formed Collateral damage increases Instability in geopolitics, also brings instability in our lives This is the truth Being informed about the world is important Forming your opinions by yourself is important But at the same time  , war mongering is harmful for all of us Because, directly or indirectly a war impacts all of us I hope our audience is smart enough to understand our message through this video If you got to learn something new from this video, then do share this video  with your friends And if you want to know about Israel Palestine conflict in detail Then let us know in the comments Because informing you about the world news around us matters to me", "doc_id": "595.56 - 721.079", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "feb3d33d057fa5632370b343543b1bc674ff49992814fc35273c892e2e1117e3", "extra_info": null, "node_info": null, "relationships": {}, "__type__": "1"}}, "ref_doc_info": {"0 - 299.159": {"doc_hash": "fe2e56663d3f6232514283eb6f04c96db073449b728cda359a7d58716fb61557"}, "299.159 - 595.56": {"doc_hash": "696c29c2d1833b890c970e32bc5260096e0391d0908cf63bb55894132dfd62a2"}, "595.56 - 721.079": {"doc_hash": "feb3d33d057fa5632370b343543b1bc674ff49992814fc35273c892e2e1117e3"}}}}}
