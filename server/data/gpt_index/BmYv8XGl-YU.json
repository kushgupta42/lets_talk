[{"text": "dr. Mark Zuckerberg I love this place  thank you all for coming out in the rain  the pouring rain we're going to make  this worth it for you president Faust  Board of Overseers  faculty friends alumni proud parents  members of the ad board and graduates of  the greatest university in the world I'm  honored to be here with you today  because let's face it you accomplished  something I never could if I get through  this speech today it'll be the first  time I actually finished something here  at Harvard class of 2017 congratulations  now I'm an unlikely speaker today not  just because I dropped out but because  we're technically in the same generation  we walk this yard less than a decade  apart we studied the same ideas and  slept through the same act 10 lectures  we may have taken different roads to get  here especially if you came all the way  from the quad but today I want to share  what I've learned about our generation  and the world we're all building  together but first these are the last  couple of days to brought back a lot of  good memories how many of you remember  exactly where you were and what you were  doing when you got that email telling  you you got into Harvard  [Applause]  I was playing I was playing the video  game civilization and I ran downstairs  and got my dad and for some reason his  first reaction was to video me opening  an email that could have been a really  really sad video but I swear getting  into Harvard is the thing my parents are  most proud of me for my mom is nodding  y'all know what I'm talking about look  guys it's tough to beat this you'll see  when you get out there how many of you  remember your first lecture here at  Harvard mine was computer science 121  with the incredible Harry Lewis Harry I  [Applause]  was running late for class so I throw on  a t-shirt and I didn't realize until  afterwards I put it on inside out and  backwards my tag was sticking out the  front I couldn't figure out why no one  in class would talk to me except for  this one guy k-x gym he just went with  it we started doing our problem sets  together and now he runs a big part of  Facebook and that class of 2017 is why  you should be nice to people but my best  memory from Harvard is meeting Priscilla  I had just launched this prank website  face mask and the ad board wanted to see  me everyone thought I was going to get  kicked out my parents drove up here to  help me pack my stuff my friends threw  me a going-away party who does that  as luck would have it Priscilla was at  that party with her friends and we met  in line for the bathroom in the FO ho  bell tower and then what must be one of  the all-time most romantic lines I  turned her and said I'm getting kicked  out in three days so we need to go on to  date quickly actually any of you  graduating today can use that line I'm  getting kicked out today we need to go  on a date fast I didn't end up getting  kicked out I did that to myself  Priscilla and I started dating and you  know that movie made it seem like  Facemash was so important to starting  Facebook it wasn't but without Facemash  I never would have met Priscilla and  Priscilla is the most important person  in my life so you could still say it was  the most important thing I built in my  time here  [Applause]  we have all started lifelong friendships  here and some of us even families that's  why I'm so grateful to this place thanks  Harvard today I want to talk about  purpose but I'm not here to give you the  standard commencement about finding your  purpose  we're Millennials we try to do that  instinctively instead I'm here to tell  you that finding your purpose isn't  enough the challenge for our generation  is to create a world where everyone has  a sense of purpose one of my favorite  stories is when JFK went to go visit the  NASA Space Center and he saw janitor  holding a broom and he asked him what he  was doing and the janitor replied mr.  president I'm helping put a man on the  moon purpose is that feeling that you  are a part of something bigger than  yourself that you are needed and that  you have something better ahead to work  for purpose is what creates true  happiness and you are graduating at a  time when this is especially important  when our parents graduated that sense of  purpose reliably came from your job your  church your community but today  technology and automation are  eliminating many jobs membership in a  lot of communities has been declining  and a lot of people are feeling  disconnected and depressed and are  trying to fill a void in their lives as  I've traveled around I've sat with  children in juvenile detention and  opioid addict who told me that maybe  their lives would have turned out  differently if they just had something  to do and after school program or  somewhere to go I've met factory workers  who know their old jobs aren't coming  back and are just trying to find their  path ahead for our society to keep  moving forward we have a generational  challenge to not only create new jobs  but create a renewed sense of purpose I  remember that night I launched Facebook  from that little dorm in Kirkland house  I went to Doakes with my friend kayaks  and I remember telling him clearly that  I was excited to help connect the  Harvard community but one day someone  would connect the whole world the thing  is it never even occurred to me that  that someone might be us we were just  college kids we didn't know anything  about that there were all these great  big technology companies with all these  resources and I just assumed one of them  would do it but this idea was so clear  to us that all people want to connect so  we just kept working on it  day after day after day and I know that  a lot of you are going to have your own  stories just like this a change in the  world that seems so clear that you are  sure someone else is going to do it but  they're not you will but it's not enough  to have that purpose yourself you also  have to create a sense of purpose for  others and I found that out the hard way  you see my hope was never to build a  company I wanted to have an impact and  as all these people started joining us I  just assumed that that's what they  wanted to do too so I never took the  time to explain what it was that I hoped  we'd built a couple years in some big  companies wanted to buy us I didn't want  to sell I wanted to see if we could  connect more people and we were building  the first version of newsfeed at the  time and I thought if we could just  launch this it could change how we all  learn about the world nearly everyone  else wanted to sell without a sense of  higher purpose  this was their startup dream come true  and it tore our company apart after one  particularly tense argument one of my  closest advisors told me if I didn't  agree to sell the company right now I  would regret that decision for the rest  of my life  relationships were so afraid that within  a year or so every single person on our  management team was gone that was my  hardest time leading Facebook I believed  in what we were doing but I felt alone  and worse it was my fault  I wondered if I was just wrong an  impostor a 22 year old kid who had no  idea how things actually worked now  years later I understand it that is how  things work when there's no sense of  higher purpose so it's up to all of us  to create it so we can all keep moving  forward together and today I want to  talk about three ways that we can create  a world where everyone has a sense of  purpose by taking on big meaningful  projects together by redefining equality  so everyone has the freedom to pursue  their purpose and by building community  all across the world so first let's take  on big meaningful projects our  generation is going to have to deal with  tens of millions of jobs replaced by  automation like self-driving cars and  trucks but we have the potential to do  so much more than that every generation  has its defining works more than three  hundred thousand people work to put that  man on the moon including that janitor  millions of volunteers immunize children  around the world against polio and  millions of more people built the Hoover  Dam and other great projects and now  it's our generations turn to do great  things now I know maybe you're thinking  I don't know how to build a dam I don't  know how to get a million people  involved in anything well let me tell  you a secret  no one does when they begin ideas don't  come out fully formed they only become  clear as you work on them you just have  to get started if I had to know  everything about connecting people  before I got started I never would have  built Facebook  movies and pop culture just get this all  wrong the idea of a single Eureka moment  is a dangerous lie it makes us feel  inadequate because we feel like we  haven't had ours yet and it prevents  people with seeds of good ideas from  ever getting started in the first place  oh and you know what else movies get  wrong about innovation no one writes  math formulas on glass okay all right  that's not a thing okay it's really good  to be idealistic  but be prepared to be misunderstood  anyone working on a big vision is going  to get called crazy even if you end up  right anyone taking on a complex problem  is going to get blamed for not fully  understanding it even though it's  impossible to know everything up front  anyone taking initiative will always get  criticized for moving too fast because  there's always someone who wants to slow  you down in our society we often don't  take on big things because we're so  afraid of making mistakes that we ignore  all the things wrong today if we do  nothing the reality is anything we do  today is going to have some issues in  the future but that can't stop us from  getting started so what are we waiting  for  it is time for our generation defining  great works how about stopping climate  change before we destroy the planet and  getting millions of people involved  [Applause]  manufacturing and installing solar  panels how about curing all diseases and  getting people involved by asking  volunteers to share their health data  track their health data and share their  genomes you know today our society spend  more than 50 times as much treating  people were sick as we invest in finding  cures so people get sick in the first  place it makes no sense we can fix this  how about modernizing democracy so  everyone can vote online and how about  personalizing education so everyone can  learn these achievements are all within  our reach let's do them all in a way  that gives everyone in our society a  role let's do big things not just to  create progress but to create purpose so  taking on big meaningful projects  together is the first thing we can do to  create a world where everyone has a  sense of purpose  the second is redefining our idea of  equality so everyone has the freedom to  pursue their purpose now many of our  parents had stable jobs throughout their  careers but in order generation we're  all a little entrepreneurial whether  we're starting our own projects or  finding our role in another one and you  know that's great because our culture of  entrepreneurship is how we create so  much progress an entrepreneurial culture  thrives when it is easy to try lots of  new ideas Facebook wasn't the first  thing I built I also built chat systems  and games study tools and music players  and I'm not alone  JK Rowling got rejected 12 times before  she finally wrote and published Harry  Potter even Beyonce had to make hundreds  of songs to get halo the greatest  successes come from having the freedom  to fail now today we have a level of  wealth and equality that hurts everyone  when you can't when you don't have the  freedom to take your idea and turn it  into a historic enterprise we all lose  and right now today our society is way  over indexed on rewarding people when  their success  and we don't do nearly enough to make  sure that everyone can take lots of  different shots now let's face it there  is something wrong with our system when  I can leave here and make billions of  dollars in ten years while millions of  students can't even afford to pay off  their loans let alone start a business  look I know a lot of entrepreneurs and I  don't know a single person who gave up  on starting a business because they were  worried they might not make enough money  but I know too many people who haven't  had the chance to pursue their dreams  because they didn't have a cushion to  fall back on if they failed we all know  you don't get successful just by having  a good idea or working hard you get  successful by being lucky - if I had to  support my family growing up instead of  having the time to learn how to code if  I didn't know that I was going to be  fine if Facebook didn't work out then I  wouldn't be standing up here today and  if we were honest we all know how much  luck we've had to get to this point in  our lives every generation expands its  definition of equality previous  generations fought for the vote and  civil rights they had the New Deal and  Great Society and now it's time for our  generation to define a new social  contract  we should have a society that measures  progress not just by economic metrics  like GDP but by how many of us have a  role we find meaningful we should  explore ideas like universal basic  income to make sure that everyone has a  cushion to try new ideas we're all going  to change jobs and roles many times so  we need affordable childcare to get to  work and healthcare that's not tied to  just one employer and we're all going to  make mistakes so we need a society  that's less focused on locking us up and  stigmatizing us when we do and as our  technology keeps on evolving we need a  society that is more focused on  providing continuous education through  our lives and yes giving everyone the  freedom to pursue purpose isn't going to  be free people like me should pay for it  and a lot of you are going to do really  well and you should too  that is why Priscilla and I started the  Chan Zuckerberg initiative and committed  our wealth to promoting equal  opportunity these are the values of our  whole generation it was never a question  of if we were going to do this the only  question was when Millennials are  already one of the most charitable  generations in history in just one year  more than three and four u.s.  Millennials donated to charity and more  than seven and ten raise money for  another one but it's not just about  giving money you can also give time and  I promise you if you just take an hour  to a week that's all it takes to give  someone a hand and help them reach their  potential now maybe you're thinking  that's a lot of time I'm not sure if I  have that much time I used to think that  you know when Priscilla graduated from  Harvard she became a teacher and before  she do education work with me she told  me that I needed to get my own  experience teaching a class at first I  complained you know I'm kind of busy  running this company but she insisted so  I taught an after-school program at the  local Boys and Girls Club on  entrepreneurship I taught those kids  lessons on product development and  marketing and they taught me what it was  like growing up feeling targeted for  your race and what it's like having a  family member in prison  I shared stories of my time in school  and they shared their hope that one day  they would get to go to college too for  five years I've had dinner with those  students every month one of them even  through Priscilla and me our first baby  shower and next year they're going to  college  every one of them first generation and  their families we can all make time to  give someone a hand let's give everyone  the freedom to pursue purpose not just  because it's the right thing to do but  because when more people can turn their  dreams into something great we are all  better for it  [Applause]  purpose doesn't only come from work  the third way we can create a sense of  purpose for everyone is by building  community and in our generation when we  say purpose for everyone we mean  everyone in the world now quick show of  hands how many of you here are from  another country I now keep your hands up  how many of you are friends with one of  these folks now we're talking see we  have we have grown up connected in a  recent survey of Millennials around the  world asking what most defines our  identity the most popular answer wasn't  nationality ethnicity or religion  it was citizen of the world that's a big  deal every generation expands the circle  of people we consider one of us and in  our generation that now includes the  whole world we understand that the great  arc of human history bends towards  people coming together in ever greater  numbers from tribes to cities to nations  to achieve things that we could not on  our own we get that our greatest  opportunities are now global we can be  the generation that ends poverty that  ends disease and we get that our  greatest challenges need global  responses to no country can fight  climate change alone or prevent  pandemics progress now requires coming  together not just those cities or  Nations  but also as a global community but we  live in an unstable time there are  people left behind by globalization  across the whole world and it's tough to  care about people in other places well  we don't first feel good about our lives  here at home there's pressure to turn  inwards this is the struggle of our time  the forces of freedom openness and  global community against the forces of  authoritarianism isolationism and  nationalism forces for the flow of  knowledge trade and immigration against  those who would slow them down this is  not a battle of Nations it is a battle  of ideas there are people in every  country for more global connection and  there are good people against it and  this isn't going to be decided at the UN  either it's going to happen at the local  level when enough of us feel a sense of  purpose and stability and our own lives  that we can start to open up and care  about everyone else too and the best way  to do that is to start building local  communities right now we all get a lot  of meaning from our communities who  hears from Elliot house how about Lowell  I know you guys found community because  you literally live right on top of each  other and Mather  [Music]  obviously not there whether our  communities our houses or sports teams  churches or acapella groups they give us  that sense that we're a part of  something bigger that we are not alone  they give us the strength to expand our  horizons and that's why it's so striking  that over the past few decades  membership in all kinds of communities  has declined by as much as one quarter  that's a lot of people who now need to  find a sense of purpose somewhere else  but I know that we can rebuild these  communities and start new ones because  many of you already are  I met  Agnes ago a who's graduating today Agnes  where are you Agnes spent her childhood  navigating conflict zones with human  trafficking in Uganda and now she's  trained thousands of law enforcement  officials to keep communities safe  I met Kayla Oakley and Neha Jain  graduating today to stand up guys  Kayla Neha started a non-profit that  connects people suffering from chronic  illnesses with people in their  communities who are willing to help out  and I met David Rosner who's graduating  from the Kennedy School today David  stand up David is a former city  councilor who fought to make Mexico City  the first Latin American city to pass  marriage equality even before San  Francisco and this is my story - a  student in a dorm connecting one  community at a time and keeping at it  until one day we can connect the whole  world change starts local even global  change starts small with people like us  in our generation the struggle of  whether we connect more whether we  achieve our greatest opportunities comes  down to this your ability to build  communities and create a world where  every single person has a sense of  purpose  class of 2017 you are graduating into a  world that needs purpose and it's up to  you to create it now maybe you're asking  yourself can I really do this well  remember when I told you about that  class I taught at the Boys & Girls Club  one day after class I was talking to my  students about going to college and one  of my top students raised his hand and  said that he wasn't sure he could go to  college because he's undocumented he  wasn't sure if they'd take him  last year I took him out to breakfast  for his birthday and I wanted to get him  a gift so I asked him what he wanted and  he just started talking about struggles  that he saw other students in his class  facing and finally said you know I'd  really just like a book on social  justice I was blown away here is a young  guy who has every reason to be cynical  he wasn't sure if the country he calls  home the only one he's known was going  to deny him his dream of going to  college but he wasn't feeling sorry for  himself he wasn't even thinking of  himself he has a greater sense of  purpose and he's going to bring people  along with him it says something about  our situation today that I can't even  say his name because I don't want to put  him at risk but if a high school senior  who doesn't know what the future holds  for him can do his part to move the  world forward then we owe it to the  world to do our part to  so before you walk out those gates one  last time  and as we sit here in front of Memorial  Church I'm reminded of a prayer  Misha Barak that I say whenever I face a  big challenge that I sing to my daughter  thinking of her future when I tuck her  in at night and it goes may the source  of strength whose blessed the ones  before us help us find the courage to  make our lives a blessing I hope you  find the courage to make your life a  blessing congratulations class of 2017  good luck out there  [Applause]", "start": 0.0, "duration": 23.029}]
