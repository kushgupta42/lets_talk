There's a warrant out\nfor your arrest. Did you know that? I've been ordered\nto divert to Rangoon. Another week.\nI haven't got a film yet. Please. I have risked\neverything I have on this. No, Denham.\nYou risked everything I have. What do you want? Tell me what you want.\nI'll give you anything. I want you off my ship. Set a course for Rangoon,\nMr. Hayes. I'm finished. It's over for me, Jack. How'd you think\nthis would end, Carl? Check our position.\nUse the stars. There are no stars, Captain. What is that? What?\nThat. That right there. I don't know.\nWhat is it? A coffee stain? Station the forward lookout\nand get me the depth by lead line. Aye, Captain. 30 fathoms, no bottom! Reduce speed,\nsteerage way only. Dead slow ahead, both. You should stop the ship. 15 degrees port. We're getting out of here,\nMr. Hayes. We'll find clear conditions. We have seabed! 25 fathoms! We're shallowing! 20 degrees starboard! Captain, you don't know\nwhere the hell you're going! Get me another reading! Another reading! 22 fathoms! Douse the lights.\nAye, Captain. 10 fathoms! Wall! There's a wall ahead! Stop engines! Give me some power!\nHalf astern both. Half astern both, Captain! Rocks! Rocks! Rocks to starboard, Captain! To port! Rocks everywhere! Take the wheel, Hayes. Hang on! Full ahead! Rocks to port, Captain! Turn, Captain!\nStarboard, starboard! Ah! Shore up that breach! Get me more men down here now!\nCome on, move, move! Hayes!\nShe's taken a pounding! What about the prop? The shaft's not bent,\nas far as we can tell. But she struck hard\nagainst the rock! Captain! Better come up quick! Right there! Want me to bring them back? I don't give a damn\nabout Carl Denham. I want this ship fixed and ready\nto float on the next high tide! Come on, move it. We're leaving, Mr. Hayes. Can you believe this, Jack? We've got our picture. Why does Marlow\nkeep going up the river? Why doesn't he turn back? There's a part of him\nthat wants to, Jimmy. A part deep inside himself\nthat sounds a warning. But there's another part... that needs to know. To defeat the thing\nwhich makes him afraid. \"We could not understand\nbecause we were too far... <i>\"and could not remember...</i> <i>\"because we were traveling\nin the night of first ages...</i> <i>\"of those ages\nthat are gone...</i> <i>\"leaving hardly a sign,\nand no memories.</i> <i>\"We are accustomed to look...</i> <i>\"upon the shackled form\nof a conquered monster...</i> <i>\"but there...</i> <i>\"there you could look\nat a thing monstrous and free.\"</i> It's not\nan adventure story... is it, Mr. Hayes? No, Jimmy. It's not. It's deserted.\nOf course it's deserted. Use your eyes, Preston.\nThe place is a ruin. Nobody's lived here\nfor hundreds of years. Mr. Denham,\nI think we should go back. I will handle this. Look. Chocolate. You like chocolate? It's good to eat. You want? Take it. Here, put it in your hand\nand take it. For God's sakes, Denham,\nleave the native alone. She doesn't want\nthe chocolate. Aah! All right! Just a bunch of women\nand old folks! They're harmless! Ann! Jack. Seen enough? Lighten the ship! Anything that's not\nbolted down goes overboard! Just heave it! We got away. We gotta be grateful\nfor that, gentlemen. What about Mike?\nHe didn't get away! He's still there! Mike died doing what he believed in!\nHe didn't die for nothing. And I'll tell you something else.\nI'm gonna finish this film for Mike! I'll finish it... and I'll donate the proceeds... to his wife and kids. Because that man is a hero,\nand he deserves nothing less. Hear, hear! Chuck everything\nexcept for the potatoes! What's wrong now?\nExcuse me, Shakespeare. Come on, men! Come on, hurry! Drop those spare cables overboard!\nGo on, just chuck it! Where's Ann?\nWhat? Where's Ann? Ann! She's free! Full ahead, both engines! Ann! No! Stop! Turn back! Stop! We have to turn back. They've taken Ann. Kong! Kong! Kong! All hands going ashore!\nReport to stations! Jump to it!\nJump to it, gentlemen! We're doing it, Mr. Hayes! Come on, move it! Pull harder! Row! Row! Come on! Kong. Spread out! Find her! Miss Darrow! Check up there, Jimmy!\nEverybody stay together! Ann! She's here somewhere! What in God's name was that? Behind the wall! Behind the wall! She's gone! Carl, what is it? You saw something. You can take Hayes\nand 15 others. I'll put a guard on the gate\nuntil you return. The rest of you\nstay with the ship. Choy! Not you, Jimmy. Come on, Mr. Hayes.\nLook at them. None of them knows\nwhich way to point a gun. Stay here. Miss Darrow needs me! No! Bring the tripod\nand all of the film stock. You wanna go\nwith the 6-inch lens? The wide-angle\nwill do just fine. You got guns. You got food.\nYou got the ammo. And you got 24 hours! 24 hours? This time tomorrow,\nwe haul anchor. Miss Darrow! Ann! Miss Darrow! Miss Darrow! Miss Darrow! Ann! No! Ann!\nMiss Darrow! Ann! Christ,\nit's a bleeding bone yard! They've been ripped\nlimb from limb. Ann! Ann! Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes.\nPretend you didn't see me. Jesus, Jimmy.\nHey, I need that! I'm not giving you a gun! You were younger than me\nwhen they gave you one! I was in the army.\nI was trained. I had a drill sergeant. I wanna help bring her back. Don't make me regret it. Conserve your ammunition! I'm knackered. I can't breathe.\nI need a breather. Fellows, we don't\nhave time for this. We've lost too much ground\nalready. Come on, get up! They're not about to quit on you.\nCut them some slack. All right,\nyou got five minutes! Everybody stay in sight. Over here. I'm gonna get\na wide shot of the valley. Bloody Nora! Is that\nwhat took Miss Darrow? There's only one creature capable\nof leaving a footprint that size. The abominable snowman. Yeah, a snowman.\nWe dead meat. It's got to be what,\n20, 25 feet? Carl saw it. Let's ask him. Denham! Where'd he go? Walk forward, Bruce. What?\nYou're the star\nof this picture. Get into character\nand head toward the animals. What the hell\nkind of a place is this? Are you sure about this, Denham? Don't we have a stand-in\nfor this type of thing? I need you in the shot,\nor people will say they're fake. Nobody's gonna think\nthese are fake. You're making them nervous.\nNo sudden movements. I'm not moving. Mother of God. What's this? What is it? What is it?\nWhere's Carl? Carl?\nHe's up there, filming. Bugger this! Run, Jack! Holy Christ.\nGo, Jimmy, run! Run, run, run! Let go!\nI'm not leaving the camera! Let go, you idiot! Carl, run! Get down. Look out! Coming through! No! Carl! Carl! Get up! Come on. Come on. Mr. Denham! Mr. Denham! Herb! Herb, come on! Take the tripod! Come on! I'm pulling you up!\nHold on to your end! Go! No, I'm not going anywhere\nwithout you! You gotta leave me!\nShut up and hold on! Jimmy, do a head count. I want to know how many\nare injured and how bad. Injured? Four of us are dead! It's not your fault. What happened to Herb\nis no one's fault. You're absolutely right, Preston. And I'll tell you\nsomething else. Herbert didn't die\nfor nothing. He died for what he believed in,\nand I'm gonna honor that. He died believing there was still\nsome mystery left in this world. And we could all\nhave a piece of it... for the price\nof an admission ticket. God damn it, Preston,\nwe're gonna finish this film for Herb. We'll finish it... and donate the proceeds\nto his wife and kids. All right, we gotta\nget back to the ship. Englehorn sails in nine hours.\nSo? We gotta find Miss Darrow. Hey, do you hear me?\nWe're gonna be stranded here. Look, fellows,\nMiss Darrow was a great gal, no question. And she was\na wonderful person. It's a terrible loss\nand we're all gonna miss her. I always knew you were nothing like\nthe tough guy you play on screen. I just never figured you\nfor a coward. Hey, pal! Hey, wake up. Heroes don't look like me,\nnot in the real world. In the real world, they got bad teeth,\na bald spot, and a beer gut. I'm just an actor with a gun,\nwho's lost his motivation. Be seeing you. Anyone else? Well, see you.\nCome on. No! I said no! That's all there is.\nThere isn't any more. What is it? Mr. Hayes? If anything happens,\nI want you to run. You understand? I'm not a coward.\nI ain't gonna run. It's not about\nbeing brave, Jimmy. Go back! Back across the log! I ain't gonna run!\nGet Jimmy out of here! No!\nGet back! Get back! Move back! No! No!\nStay back. No! Look at me. Let him go!\nYou got to run, Jimmy. Do as I say. Go with Jack. Run! No! Shoot him! No! Here! Over here! Hold on! Hold on! Lumpy! Help me! Bloody hell, Choy! No! Oh, my! Wait! Carl. Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy. You all right? No. Get off! Get it off! Get off! Get it off! Kill it! Stop moving! Get it off my face! Stay still.\nI am standing still. Hold on.\nBe careful! Don't move!\nStay away from the walls! Coming through! Get out of there now! Climb! It's beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful. There. Thank God. Don't thank God.\nThank Mr. Baxter. He insisted on\na rescue mission. Me? I knew you'd be okay. That's the thing\nabout cockroaches. No matter how many times\nyou flush them down the toilet... they always crawl\nback up the bowl. Hey, buddy?\nI'm out of the bowl. I'm dryin' off my wings\nand trekkin' across the lid. Driscoll! Don't be a fool!\nGive it up. It's useless! She's dead. She's not dead. Jack's gonna bring her back... and the ape will be\nhard on his heels. We can still\ncome out of this thing okay. More than okay. Think about it. You got a boat full of chloroform\nwe could put to good use. You wanna trap the ape? I don't think so. Isn't that what you do?\nLive animal capture? I heard you were the best. Jack! Look after yourself! Keep the gate open, will you? Sure thing, buddy. Good luck! I'm sorry. Ann. Jack! Run! Jack, Jack! Jack. Ann, it's okay. Ann, let's go.\nLet's go. Come on! Let's go. Come on. Come on! Carl! Please! Somebody help us! They've gone. Carl. Christ. Carl! Drop the bridge.\nDo it now, for Christ's sake! Not yet. Wait. Wait. Wait! Come on! Now!\nThrow them! Throw! No! Hold him! Are you out of your mind? Stop!\nHold the line! Keep him down! Heave! Please! No! Stop! Jack. No.\nGet her out of... They'll kill him!\nThere's nothing we can do. No!\nGet her out of his sight! It's too late. Throw it! Look out! Let go of me. We gotta go. Come on. Come on. Stop it. Leave me alone! Ann, please come on. Kill it! No. No! It's over,\nyou goddamn lunatic! All of you, run! Come on. Come on! Move it! Move it! Come on, come on! Stay there!\nIt's me he wants! Please stop this!\nMove! Hold onto her! Ann, go.\nPlease, I can stop this! No! Ann, stay there! Get it out! Get the hell out of here! Come on!\nJimmy, don't be crazy! Come on. Don't be crazy. Let me go! Cast off! Come on, Carl! Row! Wait. Row, God damn it! Go back. Jimmy, no! No! No! Don't! Leave him alone! Hide out in the back! Wait! No! No! No! Please don't! The whole world\nwill pay to see this. We're millionaires, boys! I'll share it with all of you! In a few months his name will\nbe up in lights on Broadway! Kong!\nThe Eighth Wonder of the World! What can I say?\nWhat can I say? Any comments, sir? The Mayor, thank you. Ready. What am I? Thank you very much. Get used to it. Listen, great to see you.\nReady? I'm really appreciating that... Look at you!\nI remember you. You're a lucky guy, Denham.\nAm I a lucky guy? Maybe you're the lucky guy. Carl! Zelman! I told you. I know you did\nand I appreciate it. Let's get a shot of this. Come on. Big smile.\nYeah! That's great! <i>Look at yourself.\nLook at what you've become.</i> No woman is worth this.\nThis woman is worth it. I don't care what it takes,\nI gotta win her back. Oh, really? She's not gonna buy\nthis for a second. Shut up and hand me\nthe grapefruit! <i>You're writing a comedy?\nYes, I am.</i> <i>I'm writing it for you.</i> <i>Why would you do that?</i> <i>Why would I write a play for you?</i> <i>Isn't it obvious?</i> Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't help but overhear. So, he took me to this\nfancy French restaurant... and halfway through the\nhors d'oeuvres, he clutches my hand. And that's when he\ntold you how he felt? No. He never said it.\nHe never said it? He probably thought\nhe didn't need to say it. Well, then how does she know\nthat it's real? He said it was not about the words.\nOh, please! If you feel it, you say it.\nIt's really very simple. He said we'd talk about it later.\nOnly there was no later. It never happened. That's how it ended. He just let you walk away?\nHe didn't try to save it? I honestly believed\nthings might actually work out... which was really very... foolish. Men.\nOh, they'll give you the world... but they let the one thing\nthat truly matters... slip through their fingers. Typical. They're so busy being brave,\nthey forget to use their brains. Romance. Who needs it? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen... I'm here to tell you\na very strange story. The story of our adventure... in which 17 of our party\nsuffered horrible deaths... their lives lost... in pursuit of\na savage beast... a monstrous aberration of nature. But even the meanest\nbrute can be tamed. Yes, ladies and gentlemen,\nas you will see... the beast was no match... for the charms of a girl. A girl from New York... Who melted his heart... bringing to mind\nthat old Arabian proverb... \"And lo, the beast looked\nupon the face of beauty... \"and beauty stayed his hand. \"And from that day forward,\nhe was as one dead.\" And now, ladies and gentlemen,\nI'm going to show you... the greatest thing\nyour eyes have ever beheld. He was a king in the world he knew,\nbut he comes to you now a captive. Ladies and gentlemen... I give you Kong,\nThe Eighth Wonder of the World! Don't be alarmed.\nIt's perfectly safe. These chains are made\nof chrome steel! Observe, if you will... I am touching the beast. I am actually laying my hand\non the 25-foot gorilla. Crank 'em up, fellas. And now, we have\nin the auditorium tonight... a surprise guest. The real-life hero of this story. The man who hunted down\nthe mighty Kong! The man who risked all to win\nthe freedom of a helpless female. A big hand for Mr. Bruce Baxter! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. He was right. About there still being some\nmystery left in this world... and we can all have\na piece of it... for the price\nof an admission ticket. That's the thing you come\nto learn about Carl. His unfailing ability to\ndestroy the things he loves. Please remain calm,\nladies and gentlemen... for we now come to the\nclimax of this savage ritual. The sacrifice\nof a beautiful young girl. Behold her terror as she is\noffered up to the mighty Kong! A big hand, folks,\nfor the bravest girl I've ever met! Miss Ann Darrow. Save me from the beast! Help me! Where is she? Where's Ann?\nI have no idea. I heard he offered her all kinds of\nmoney and she turned him down flat. <i>Pack up all my cares and woe</i> <i>Here I go</i> <i>Singing low</i> <i>Bye bye</i> <i>Blackbird</i> <i>Where somebody waits for me</i> <i>Sugar's sweet</i> <i>So is he</i> <i>Bye bye</i> <i>Blackbird</i> Here's your story, boys. \"Beauty and the man\nwho saved her from the beast.\" No. We have to get these people\nout of here. Everyone needs to leave, okay?\nCome on. Let him roar.\nIt makes a swell picture. Head for the exits. Get your own seat, buddy.\nYou're not having mine. Excuse me, fellows. Coming through.\nComing through, fellows. Get me down! Help me, please! Somebody! Somebody help me! Go! Go! Get out! Go! Go! There they are. Go! Wait for me! Go back! This way! Help! No! Taxi! Follow that ape. Come on, pal,\nwe gotta draw him off. It's all yours, buddy. Hey, get out of here, lady! Come on. Buddy! Come on. Come on. Look out. Jesus Christ. Fire! Stop! No. No. Beautiful. Yes. Yes, it is. Hey! Hey! Nobody past this point. You can't go in there! Hey! Stop him! Hey! Get back.\nYou're not allowed up there! What's going on? Go! No! No! Please! No! No! Ann. Ann. Move along. Just one shot! One shot! Come, come!\nBoys, how about a photo? Look at me. Come on, watch the camera. Come a little closer. That's it, folks.\nShow's over. Step back! Clear the area. That's it.\nShove off, boys. Why'd he do that? Climb up there\nand get himself cornered. The ape must have known\nwhat was coming. He's just a dumb animal.\nDidn't know nothing. What does it matter?\nAirplanes got him. It wasn't the airplanes. It was beauty killed the beast.", "doc_id": "2096.699 - 10632.966", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fc51926a90d3b310dbd1c071471bc56d915e02b8abc4ec4d4f2138421abf0610", "extra_info": null, "node_info": null, "relationships": {}, "__type__": "1"}}, "ref_doc_info": {"0 - 296.768": {"doc_hash": "876ffdc3a49aaf6f7f4f9adddd7e534e7bf92ba2b0a97a1d34257bcdd516d74a"}, "296.768 - 596.206": {"doc_hash": "d159dabcabcb1683933a81cc46c40d01f155ac117bbc0da445563b8eb3afbba7"}, "596.206 - 896.1659999999999": {"doc_hash": "ac687e00318fec3a7c63e9a92c31b19aac7a46a1b572f0144092dbd45969cc27"}, "896.1659999999999 - 1195.407": {"doc_hash": "de4ca3360280e04999148588d46e0dc92261e409e7826e6d800f408ad577d97b"}, "1195.407 - 1500.11": {"doc_hash": "a8ec7b2a6e4d60e5ff299670b8be1dd64d6b81998fbebe34b009566cad3b3fed"}, "1500.11 - 1798.0349999999999": {"doc_hash": "4c14c28a27a9c680c425c814485393e2233cee108ce16e0bde4cb22eb372251f"}, "1798.0349999999999 - 2096.699": {"doc_hash": "e5825b24ab262426cbad935f558d8f71393bc1ad6ddbfecfaae15713a4c93567"}, "2096.699 - 10632.966": {"doc_hash": "fc51926a90d3b310dbd1c071471bc56d915e02b8abc4ec4d4f2138421abf0610"}}}}}
