00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:15,448
<i>I'm sittin' on top of the world</i>

2
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:17,458
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

3
00:01:17,822 --> 00:01:21,295
<i>Yes, rollin' along</i>

4
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:25,933
<i>And I'm quittin'
the blues of the world</i>

5
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:28,492
<i>I'm singin' a song</i>

6
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,130
<i>Yes, singin' a song</i>

7
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:34,334
<i>Glory hallelujah!
I just told the parson</i>

8
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,276
<i>"Hey, Par,
get ready to call"</i>

9
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:39,700
<i>Just like Humpty Dumpty</i>

10
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:42,180
<i>I'm gonna fall</i>

11
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,653
<i>And I'm sittin'
on top of the world</i>

12
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:49,451
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

13
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:51,856
<i>Rollin' along</i>

14
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:54,623
<i>Don't want any millions</i>

15
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:57,096
<i>I'm gettin' my share</i>

16
00:01:57,165 --> 00:01:58,996
<i>I've only got one suit
Just one</i>

17
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:00,193
Move along.

18
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:02,293
<i>That's all I can wear</i>

19
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,838
<i>A bundle of money</i>

20
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:07,306
<i>Don't make me feel gay</i>

21
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,775
<i>A sweet little honey</i>

22
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:13,281
<i>Is making me say</i>

23
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:17,785
<i>And I'm sittin', sittin'
on top, top of the world</i>

24
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:20,413

25
00:02:20,489 --> 00:02:23,617
<i>Rollin' along</i>

26
00:02:23,692 --> 00:02:28,152
<i>And I'm quittin' quittin'
the blues blues of the world</i>

27
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,721
<i>I'm singin' a song</i>

28
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:33,324
<i>Yes, singin' a song</i>

29
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:36,529
<i>Glory hallelujah!
I just told the parson</i>

30
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:39,335
<i>"Hey, Par,
get ready to call"</i>

31
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:41,995
<i>Just like Humpty Dumpty</i>

32
00:02:42,544 --> 00:02:43,909
<i>I'm gonna fall</i>

33
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,814
<i>Yeah! I'm sittin'
on top, top of the world</i>

34
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:50,006
Oh!

35
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:51,643
<i>I'm rollin' along</i>

36
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,689
<i>Rollin' along</i>

37
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:07,968
That's a funny one.
Isn't that funnier?

38
00:03:08,036 --> 00:03:09,264
It's hysterical, Manny.

39
00:03:09,337 --> 00:03:10,736
As long as we're laughing...

40
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:12,238
we won't cry
over the box office.

41
00:03:12,307 --> 00:03:13,899
Talk about depressing.

42
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:17,502
Twenty girls in feather boas
prancing around like circus ponies.

43
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,103
That's depressing.

44
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,513
I love a good chorus line.

45
00:03:23,552 --> 00:03:26,112
What's this?
It's a play.

46
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:27,678
Who wrote it, Annie?

47
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:29,553
Some guy. Driscoll.

48
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:31,253
Driscoll.

49
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:33,191
From the Federal Theatre.

50
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:36,628
Don't knock it, honey.
At least they got an audience.

51
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:40,234
It'll pick up.
Isn't that right, Manny?

52
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:45,463
It always does.

53
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:47,466
See you tomorrow.

54
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:51,638
The trick is to start to build right
from the back of your throat.

55
00:03:53,348 --> 00:03:55,339
Works well
out through the nose, too.

56
00:03:55,417 --> 00:03:57,214
Have you eaten today?

57
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:58,479
Oh...

58
00:03:58,553 --> 00:04:00,851
I'm not hungry.
Don't worry about me.

59
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:02,116
Hey.

60
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:05,154
You're all I've got.

61
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:08,858
Come on, take me to dinner.

62
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:10,858
Okay.

63
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:14,066
You think the kitchen
will still be open on third?

64
00:04:14,302 --> 00:04:16,668
Soup and biscuits.
Perfect.

65
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:25,672
Harry, what's going on?

66
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:30,213
Hey, open up! We work here.
Not anymore, lady.

67
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:33,846
It's all right for you.
We haven't had a paycheck in two weeks.

68
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:35,583
How we gonna eat?

69
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,782
They're not getting away with this!
They just did.

70
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,294
Ann, it's no use.

71
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:44,293
The show, it's over.
It's done.

72
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,362
I'm done.

73
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:50,532
I'm leaving, Annie.

74
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:54,299
I'm going back to Chicago.

75
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,768
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,506
I'm sorry, Annie.

77
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:04,919
Ever since you were small,
people been letting you down.

78
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:08,885
You gotta think of yourself now.

79
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:11,751
You should try out for that part.

80
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:16,828
Oh, I know
what you're thinking.

81
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:20,798
Every time you reach out
for something you care about...

82
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:23,599
fate comes along
and snatches it away.

83
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:26,263
But not this time, Annie.

84
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,365
Not this time.

85
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:35,647
Oh, hello, Mr. Weston.
Oh, jeez.

86
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,785
Look, miss,
I told you already, call my office.

87
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:40,787
Leave your r�sum�
with my secretary.

88
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:43,915
Now, why would I want to
do that when we can talk about it in person?

89
00:05:43,992 --> 00:05:45,619
Because that's what
a smart girl would do.

90
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:48,162
But I already sent you my r�sum�.
You returned it unopened.

91
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,255
What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very
particular about who he works with.

92
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,994
Please, just an audition.
That's all I'm asking.

93
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:54,262
Jesus, you don't give up, do you?

94
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:55,894
Mr. Weston,
I know this role backwards.

95
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,939
Well, that's too bad, 'cause we
just gave the part to someone else.

96
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:01,407
I'm sorry, kid.
The play is cast.

97
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:07,174
I know times are tough.

98
00:06:07,682 --> 00:06:09,240
You want my advice?

99
00:06:09,517 --> 00:06:12,645
Use what you got.
You're not bad-looking.

100
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:15,349
A girl like you
doesn't have to starve.

101
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:20,050
There's a new place.
It just opened.

102
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:28,261
Now listen, princess,
this gig ain't the Palace, you understand?

103
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:31,328
Ask for Kenny K.
Tell him I sent you.

104
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,031
Just play the date,
take the money...

105
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,001
forget you was ever there.

106
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:10,076
How much more is there?

107
00:07:10,612 --> 00:07:12,341
Another five reels.

108
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:14,045
Lights up.

109
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:23,288
This is it?

110
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,188
This is what we get
for our $40,000, Denham?

111
00:07:26,261 --> 00:07:27,888
Another one of your safari pictures?

112
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:31,056
You promised us romantic scenes with
Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie!

113
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:32,827
Come on, fellows,
you know the deal.

114
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,493
We agreed to push
Maureen's start date...

115
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:36,127
so she could get her teeth fixed.

116
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:39,037
It's not the principle
of the thing, it's the money.

117
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:41,667
Carl, you've been in production
for over two months.

118
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:44,405
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen
are gonna steam up the screen...

119
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,379
once we get them on the ship.

120
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:48,479
What ship?

121
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,378
The one that we hired
to get to the location.

122
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:55,253
What location? Carl!
You're supposed to be shooting on the back lot.

123
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:56,847
Yes, I understand that.

124
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:59,291
But, fellows, we're not
making that film anymore...

125
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,622
and I'll tell you why.

126
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:03,528
The story has changed.
The script has been rewritten.

127
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:05,725
Life intervened.

128
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:09,193
I've come into possession of a map.

129
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:13,635
The sole surviving record
of an uncharted island.

130
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:16,835
A place that was thought
to exist only in myth.

131
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:18,169
Until now.

132
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:20,271
Whoa, Carl, slow down.

133
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:21,679
Is he asking for more money?

134
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:24,343
He's asking us
to fund a wild goose chase.

135
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,879
I'm talking about a primitive
world never before seen by man.

136
00:08:30,058 --> 00:08:33,050
The ruins of an entire civilization.

137
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:37,230
The most spectacular thing
you've ever seen.

138
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:40,757
That's where
I'll shoot my picture.

139
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:45,136
Will there be boobies?

140
00:08:46,374 --> 00:08:47,602
Boobies?

141
00:08:48,076 --> 00:08:50,772
Jigglies. Jiblonkas.
Bazooms.

142
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:53,641
In my experience,
people only go to these films...

143
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:57,082
to observe the undraped form
of the native girls.

144
00:08:57,252 --> 00:08:58,719
What are you, an idiot?

145
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:01,983
You think they asked De Mille
if he would waste his time on nudie shots?

146
00:09:02,056 --> 00:09:05,685
No! They respected the filmmaker.
They showed some class.

147
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,218
Not that you'd know what
that means, you cheap lowlife!

148
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:15,995
Would you step out
for a moment, Carl?

149
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:29,240
Zelman and Associates.

150
00:09:29,717 --> 00:09:31,480
Give me that, quick.

151
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:35,179
You won't like it.
It's non-alcoholic.

152
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:39,386
Preston, you have a lot to learn
about the motion picture business.

153
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,924
Don't write him off, fellows.
He's hotheaded, sure...

154
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:47,968
but Carl Denham's made
some interesting pictures.

155
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:50,334
He's had a lot of near-success.

156
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:52,840
He's a preening self-promoter.

157
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:56,206
An ambitious no-talent.
The guy's got "loser" written all over him.

158
00:09:56,277 --> 00:09:57,767
I understand
your disappointment...

159
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:59,972
He can't direct.
He doesn't have the smarts.

160
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:02,846
He's washed up.
It's all over town.

161
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:06,347
This jumped-up little
turd's gonna bankrupt us.

162
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:08,252
The animal footage has value.

163
00:10:08,323 --> 00:10:10,757
Sure. Universal are
desperate for stock footage.

164
00:10:10,825 --> 00:10:13,225
Then sell it!
Scrap the picture.

165
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:18,659
We got to retrieve
something from this debacle.

166
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:22,160
Get him back in.

167
00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:24,795
Mr. Denham.

168
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:30,006
I want the cast and crew
on the ship within the hour.

169
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:31,204
No, Carl,
you can't do this.

170
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,440
Tell them the studio pressured
us into an early departure.

171
00:10:33,514 --> 00:10:35,539
It's not ethical!
What are they gonna do, sue me?

172
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:36,709
They can get in line.

173
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:38,217
I'm not gonna let them kill my film.

174
00:10:38,286 --> 00:10:41,722
You realize that none of the
camera equipment is on board?

175
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:44,587
We have no permits, no visas.

176
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:46,286
That's why I have you, Preston.

177
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:48,454
We have no insurance,
we have no foreign currency.

178
00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:50,463
In fact, we have
no currency of any kind.

179
00:10:50,531 --> 00:10:51,520
He's there.

180
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,430
Get in there.
Who's gonna pay for the ship?

181
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:54,593
Get in.

182
00:10:57,405 --> 00:11:01,068
You get out of there!
Come here! Step on it! Step on it!

183
00:11:01,142 --> 00:11:04,202
Get out!
You're finished, Denham!

184
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:10,414
Don't worry, Preston.
I've had a lot of practice at this.

185
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:14,047
I'm real good
at crapping the crappers.

186
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:17,482
Red Label, 80% proof...

187
00:11:17,558 --> 00:11:19,389
to be packed in a crate
marked "lemonade."

188
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,518
You got it.

189
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:22,961
Tell Maureen she doesn't have
six hours to put on her face.

190
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:25,329
If she wants to be in this picture,
she's gotta be on that boat.

191
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,028
She doesn't wanna be
in this picture.

192
00:11:29,203 --> 00:11:31,797
Maureen pulled out.
She pulled out?

193
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:33,966
Yesterday. I told you.

194
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:36,674
You said we were shooting
in Singapore, right?

195
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:38,735
That's what you told her.

196
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:41,807
Yeah, but we're not
shooting in Singapore.

197
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:46,183
God damn it, Preston, all you had
to do was look her in the eye and lie.

198
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:48,979
I got to get to a phone,
talk to Harlow's people.

199
00:11:49,057 --> 00:11:50,490
She's unavailable.

200
00:11:50,558 --> 00:11:53,391
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow?
Mae West?

201
00:11:53,695 --> 00:11:55,754
You'll never get her
into a size four.

202
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,391
You gotta get a girl that'll
fit into Maureen's costumes.

203
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:02,963
Fay's a size four.

204
00:12:03,037 --> 00:12:06,529
Yes, she is, but she's
doing a picture with RKO.

205
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:09,608
Cooper, huh?

206
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:13,141
I might have known.

207
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:15,916
You're not listening.
We got to delay the shoot.

208
00:12:15,983 --> 00:12:18,451
Shut production down.
We can't sail tonight.

209
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,952
Not an option.
Carl.

210
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:21,488
I said I'd find a girl.

211
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:23,820
For God's sake, Preston,
think like a winner!

212
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:26,724
Call Jack. I need that
goddamn screenplay!

213
00:12:28,596 --> 00:12:30,655
Defeat is always momentary.

214
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:05,691
What?

215
00:13:59,987 --> 00:14:03,286
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

216
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,890
Excuse me.

217
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:10,427
Ma'am, I think you dropped this.

218
00:14:20,007 --> 00:14:21,668
Vaudeville, huh?

219
00:14:21,742 --> 00:14:24,768
I worked vaudeville once.
That is a tough audience.

220
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:26,643
If you don't kill them fast,
they kill you.

221
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:28,181
Mr. Denham...

222
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:30,206
I want you to know...

223
00:14:30,284 --> 00:14:33,082
that I'm not in the habit
of accepting charity from strangers.

224
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:35,019
Or, for that matter...

225
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:37,647
taking things
that don't belong to me.

226
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:39,625
It was obviously
a terrible misunderstanding.

227
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:41,662
It's just that I haven't
been paid in a while.

228
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:45,130
That's awful. Anyway, Ann...
May I call you Ann?

229
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:51,603
You wouldn't happen to be
a size four, by any chance?

230
00:14:54,175 --> 00:14:56,166
No, no. Oh, God, no.

231
00:14:56,244 --> 00:14:58,769
You've got me all wrong.
Miss Darrow, please.

232
00:14:58,846 --> 00:15:00,939
I'm not that type
of person at all.

233
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:02,710
What type of person are you?

234
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:05,752
I'm someone you can trust, Ann.
I'm a movie producer.

235
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,881
Believe me, I am on the level.
No funny business. Please sit down.

236
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:12,523
Please. Please.

237
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,522
Okay.

238
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,058
Ann, I want you to imagine...

239
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:23,797
a handsome explorer
bound for the Far East.

240
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:26,169
You're filming in the Far East?

241
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:27,738
Singapore.

242
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:32,575
On board ship,
he meets a mysterious girl.

243
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,475
She's beautiful,
she's fragile, haunted.

244
00:15:37,084 --> 00:15:40,247
And she can't escape the feeling
that forces beyond her control...

245
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:44,223
are compelling her down a road
from which she cannot draw back.

246
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:48,484
It's as if her whole life has
been a prelude to this moment...

247
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:54,233
this fateful meeting
that changes everything.

248
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:58,864
And sure enough, against
her better judgment...

249
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,630
She falls in love.

250
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:02,400
Yes.

251
00:16:02,543 --> 00:16:04,534
But she doesn't trust it.

252
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:07,680
She's not even sure
if she believes in love.

253
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:10,140
Uh...

254
00:16:10,217 --> 00:16:11,411
really?

255
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:13,951
If she loves someone,
it's doomed.

256
00:16:14,021 --> 00:16:15,420
Why is that?

257
00:16:15,923 --> 00:16:18,414
Good things never last,
Mr. Denham.

258
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:26,497
So you're interested. Good.
That's settled, then.

259
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:29,092
Now, I don't wanna rush you,
but we are under some time pressure.

260
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,604
Well, I really...
Ann, I'm telling you...

261
00:16:31,672 --> 00:16:33,003
you're perfect. Look at you.

262
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:35,065
You're the saddest girl
I've ever met.

263
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:39,238
You're gonna make them weep,
Ann. You're gonna break their hearts.

264
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:42,606
See, that's where
you're wrong, Mr. Denham.

265
00:16:42,683 --> 00:16:45,277
I make people laugh,
that's what I do.

266
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:47,913
Good luck with your picture.

267
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:53,320
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

268
00:16:53,394 --> 00:16:54,793
I'm offering you money.

269
00:16:54,862 --> 00:16:58,525
Adventure, fame, the thrill of a
lifetime, and a long sea voyage.

270
00:16:58,599 --> 00:16:59,691
You want to read a script?

271
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:02,827
Jack Driscoll's turning in
a draft as we speak.

272
00:17:04,739 --> 00:17:06,206
Jack Driscoll?

273
00:17:06,273 --> 00:17:07,604
Sure. Why?

274
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:09,666
Wait. You know him?

275
00:17:10,778 --> 00:17:14,305
No, not personally.
I've seen his plays.

276
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:16,383
What a writer, huh?
And let me tell you, Ann...

277
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,476
Jack Driscoll does not want just
anyone starring in this picture.

278
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:20,918
He said to me, "Carl...

279
00:17:20,988 --> 00:17:24,355
"somewhere out there
is a woman born to play this role."

280
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,825
And as soon as I saw you,
I knew.

281
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,461
Knew what?

282
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:34,730
It was always going to be you.

283
00:17:46,847 --> 00:17:49,247
How much do I owe you?
Make it a quarter.

284
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:50,908
Keep the change.

285
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,752
Is this the moving picture ship?

286
00:17:56,357 --> 00:17:57,756
Not exactly.

287
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:00,258
It's actually
this one over here.

288
00:18:09,804 --> 00:18:13,934
Don't let appearances deceive you.
It's much more spacious on board.

289
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:16,870
Is this all of the equipment?
Yeah.

290
00:18:16,944 --> 00:18:18,036
This is all of it?
Yeah.

291
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:19,704
We're taking the Bell & Howell?
Yeah.

292
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,476
Good. You got all the lenses?
Sure.

293
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,108
Carl!
Yes!

294
00:18:24,185 --> 00:18:26,551
Get it on board, fellows, come on.

295
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:31,348
It's bad, it's bad.

296
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:33,325
They're on their way.
I've just had word.

297
00:18:33,394 --> 00:18:35,521
Who?
Men in uniform.

298
00:18:35,596 --> 00:18:37,689
The studio called the cops.

299
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,192
Englehorn! Cast off!

300
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:44,169
Hoist up the mainsail,
raise the anchor...

301
00:18:44,238 --> 00:18:46,297
whatever the hell it is
you do. We gotta leave!

302
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:48,034
I cannot do that.

303
00:18:48,442 --> 00:18:50,376
We are waiting
on the manifest.

304
00:18:50,444 --> 00:18:52,912
What? Who? English, please.

305
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,045
Paperwork, Mr. Denham.

306
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,745
I'll give you another $1,000
to leave now.

307
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:01,253
You haven't given me
the first $1,000 yet.

308
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:03,486
Can we talk about this later?

309
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:06,390
Can't you see we're in the
company of a VIP guest?

310
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,496
Ma'am.

311
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:15,766
Ann Darrow.

312
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:19,929
So you are ready
for this voyage, Miss Darrow?

313
00:19:20,207 --> 00:19:21,299
Sure.

314
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,438
Nervous?

315
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:28,981
Nervous? No.

316
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,283
Why? Should I be?

317
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,450
It isn't every woman
who would take such a risk.

318
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:41,526
Why don't I show
Miss Darrow to her cabin?

319
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:44,395
Wonderful idea.
Thank you, Preston.

320
00:19:44,465 --> 00:19:46,899
Miss Darrow,
if you would just...

321
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:52,294
Hi. My name is Preston.
Carl's assistant.

322
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,407
$2,000. It's a deal.
Will you take a check?

323
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,739
Do I have a choice?

324
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:00,312
Please follow me.

325
00:20:00,381 --> 00:20:02,645
If there's anything that you...
Excuse me, fellows.

326
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:06,618
If there's anything that you need,
please don't hesitate to ask.

327
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:27,471
Oh, Jesus!
Jack, you scared me.

328
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,944
Listen. If anyone comes to the door,
don't open it. You haven't seen me.

329
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,604
Say I got depressed
and committed suicide.

330
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:36,877
Say I stuck my head
down the toilet.

331
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:39,877
You want one?
No. I can't stay, Carl.

332
00:20:39,954 --> 00:20:42,980
I got a rehearsal for which
I am now three hours late.

333
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:46,223
What's this?
It's the script.

334
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:50,990
This is a script?

335
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,863
Jack, this is 15 pages.

336
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:56,562
I know, but they're good.
You've got 15 good pages there, Carl.

337
00:20:56,637 --> 00:20:58,628
I'm supposed to be making
a feature-length picture.

338
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:01,106
You told me I had more time.
I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

339
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:03,200
No, Jack, you can't do this to me.
I have a beginning...

340
00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:05,871
but I need a middle and an end.
I gotta have something to shoot.

341
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:09,143
Look, you got my notes.
I got to go, pal. See you.

342
00:21:13,587 --> 00:21:16,112
All right, fine.
We might as well settle up.

343
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:18,990
You're gonna pay me?

344
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:20,993
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.

345
00:21:23,197 --> 00:21:25,995
I've never known you
to volunteer cash before.

346
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:27,897
How's $2,000 sound?

347
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,003
Sounds great.

348
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:32,800
I thought it might.

349
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:35,398
Sounds great.
Okay.

350
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:38,274
Raise the spring line!

351
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:39,937
Watch the aft!

352
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:50,081
And "voil�".

353
00:21:50,758 --> 00:21:51,952
Thanks.

354
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:56,821
You've written "two grand."

355
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:02,662
So I did. Sorry about that.
Let's start from the beginning.

356
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:05,437
"Two thousand dollars."

357
00:22:13,347 --> 00:22:15,008
It is the 29th, isn't it?

358
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:17,880
Oh, come on, it's the 25th.
It's the 25th.

359
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:20,482
God, I'm sorry.
It'll just take a sec.

360
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:22,715
Never mind, Carl.
Just pay me when you get back.

361
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,155
All right.

362
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:40,631
Your cabin is the last
on the left, Mr. Baxter.

363
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:45,202
And may I just say how excited we
are to have you back with us, sir?

364
00:22:45,312 --> 00:22:47,075
Be a sport and lend a
hand here, would you?

365
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:49,615
Excuse me. I'm trying to...
I gotta get...

366
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:53,413
Christ!

367
00:22:54,221 --> 00:22:56,121
Appreciate the help, fellow.

368
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,317
Let me get the door for you.

369
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:01,584
Welcome to your
stateroom, sir.

370
00:23:07,134 --> 00:23:09,193
Dead slow ahead both,
Mr. Hayes.

371
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:11,203
Dead slow ahead both,
Captain.

372
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,546
Oh, Christ!

373
00:23:29,957 --> 00:23:31,356
God damn it!

374
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:43,203
I keep telling you, Jack,
there's no money in theater.

375
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:47,730
Oh, no! No!

376
00:23:49,176 --> 00:23:51,974
You're much better off
sticking with film.

377
00:23:52,212 --> 00:23:54,646
I don't do it
for the money, Carl.

378
00:23:56,049 --> 00:23:58,244
I happen to love the theater.

379
00:23:58,685 --> 00:24:00,175
No, you don't.

380
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:03,446
If you really loved it...

381
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:05,483
you would have jumped.

382
00:24:09,263 --> 00:24:11,163
You! This is your fault!

383
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:28,742
This room very comfortable.
Plenty dim light, fresh straw.

384
00:24:28,816 --> 00:24:30,841
Jesus. What do you keep
down here?

385
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:33,250
Lion, tiger, hippo,
you name it.

386
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:36,017
You sell them to zoos?

387
00:24:36,089 --> 00:24:37,681
Zoo, circus.

388
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,586
Skipper get big money
for rare animal.

389
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:43,855
Careful. Camel have
bad accident on floor.

390
00:24:44,031 --> 00:24:45,692
Stain unremovable.

391
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:51,303
Skipper catch
any wild animal you want.

392
00:24:51,371 --> 00:24:53,271
He'll do you real good price
on white rhino.

393
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,432
Choy.

394
00:24:56,743 --> 00:25:00,110
My apologies for not being
able to offer you a cabin.

395
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,978
Have you found an enclosure
to your taste?

396
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:05,515
Spoiled for choice.

397
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:08,316
What are you, Mr. Driscoll?
A lion?

398
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:11,118
Or a chimpanzee?

399
00:25:12,593 --> 00:25:14,220
I'll take this one.

400
00:25:27,174 --> 00:25:28,835
I told you to lock it up.

401
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:32,436
Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said...
Lumpy doesn't give the orders!

402
00:25:32,513 --> 00:25:35,573
What are you trying to do?
Put the whole ship to sleep?

403
00:25:38,886 --> 00:25:40,683
Get them out of here.

404
00:26:15,756 --> 00:26:18,691
Compliments of the chef.
Okay.

405
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:26,089
Oh, Christ. Oh, God.

406
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,999
Lamb's brains in walnut sauce.

407
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:35,835
Jimmy.

408
00:26:36,043 --> 00:26:38,011
You run those ropes
up on deck like I told you?

409
00:26:38,078 --> 00:26:40,069
Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.

410
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,282
How about you return
Mr. Driscoll's pen first?

411
00:26:52,092 --> 00:26:53,957
He don't mean no harm.

412
00:26:54,962 --> 00:26:55,951
Thanks.

413
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:57,792
I'll keep him out of your way.
It's okay.

414
00:26:57,864 --> 00:27:00,389
It's just that
he likes it down here.

415
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:03,061
It's where I found him
four years ago.

416
00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:05,997
Stowed away
in one of them back cages.

417
00:27:07,274 --> 00:27:09,708
His arm was broken
in two places.

418
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:13,778
He was wilder than
half the animals in here.

419
00:27:14,681 --> 00:27:17,275
Still won't tell me
where he came from.

420
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:20,579
But it wasn't anyplace good.

421
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:25,247
You got to straighten up.

422
00:27:25,525 --> 00:27:26,685
Jimmy.

423
00:27:27,494 --> 00:27:30,486
You don't want to be on
this ship the rest of your life.

424
00:27:30,564 --> 00:27:32,930
Yes, I do.
No, you don't, Jimmy.

425
00:27:33,133 --> 00:27:35,499
You got to be smart.
Get yourself educated.

426
00:27:35,569 --> 00:27:37,503
Give yourself some options.
Take this seriously!

427
00:27:37,571 --> 00:27:39,698
I do, Mr. Hayes, I do. Look.

428
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,330
I've been reading.

429
00:27:44,277 --> 00:27:45,972
Where'd you get this?

430
00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:47,302
I borrowed it.

431
00:27:50,851 --> 00:27:52,751
On long-term loan.

432
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:54,686
Look at this. Look, look.

433
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:58,020
"Adventures on a tramp steamer."
See? Just like us.

434
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:07,726
It's so nice to meet you,
Mr. Driscoll.

435
00:28:08,435 --> 00:28:11,302
I'm actually quite familiar
with your work, yes.

436
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:18,403
Hello, Mr. Driscoll.
It's so nice to meet you.

437
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:21,446
Actually, I'm quite familiar
with your work.

438
00:28:22,115 --> 00:28:23,742
I'm a huge fan.

439
00:28:23,817 --> 00:28:25,751
I've read everything
you've ever written.

440
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:27,286
No, too much.

441
00:28:27,988 --> 00:28:31,253
Gonna have the ship's engines
all over the dialogue.

442
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:33,323
Seagulls.

443
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:36,488
Camera noise. Wind.
Christ knows what else.

444
00:28:36,563 --> 00:28:37,723
I don't care, Mike.

445
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:40,198
You're the sound recordist.
Make it work.

446
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:44,466
Ann! Come on in.
Let me introduce you to the crew.

447
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:46,733
This is Herb, the cameraman.

448
00:28:47,307 --> 00:28:50,003
Delighted to meet you, ma'am.
Likewise.

449
00:28:50,077 --> 00:28:52,238
May I say
what a lovely dress?

450
00:28:52,312 --> 00:28:55,213
Oh, this old thing?
I just threw it on.

451
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:58,241
Isn't that
one of Maureen's costumes?

452
00:28:58,618 --> 00:29:02,349
Now, what does a girl have to do
around here to get some breakfast?

453
00:29:02,422 --> 00:29:04,447
Lumpy, you heard the lady.

454
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:07,982
Fancy my porridge
� la walnuts?

455
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:14,727
Oh, Ann, I don't believe
you've met...

456
00:29:17,137 --> 00:29:18,195
Ann?

457
00:29:18,672 --> 00:29:21,835
That's all right, Mr. Denham.
I know who this is.

458
00:29:27,114 --> 00:29:30,743
Thrilled to meet you.
It's an honor to be a part of this.

459
00:29:31,985 --> 00:29:33,384
Gee, thanks.

460
00:29:33,987 --> 00:29:36,888
Actually, I'm quite familiar
with your work.

461
00:29:37,324 --> 00:29:38,518
Really?

462
00:29:39,326 --> 00:29:41,385
Yes, and what I most admire...

463
00:29:41,461 --> 00:29:45,090
is the way you've captured the
voice of the common people.

464
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:48,130
Well, that's my job.

465
00:29:51,037 --> 00:29:53,369
I'm sure you've heard
this before, Mr. Driscoll...

466
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,907
if you don't mind me saying...

467
00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:58,035
but you don't look at all
like your photograph.

468
00:30:03,183 --> 00:30:04,878
Excuse me.
Wait a minute, Ann...

469
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:07,749
He's so much younger in person.
And much better-looking.

470
00:30:07,821 --> 00:30:09,448
Ann, stop. Stop right there.

471
00:30:09,523 --> 00:30:11,684
You see, I was just afraid
that you might be...

472
00:30:11,758 --> 00:30:14,556
one of those
self-obsessed literary types.

473
00:30:15,061 --> 00:30:16,460
I'm sorry, I'm not...
You know...

474
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:20,261
the tweedy twerp with his nose in
his book and his head up his a...

475
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:27,167
It's nice to meet you, too,
Miss Darrow.

476
00:30:41,054 --> 00:30:42,453
Good Christ!

477
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:10,917
She's standing at the railing.

478
00:31:10,984 --> 00:31:12,508
She doesn't know it yet...

479
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:17,245
But they are sailing towards disaster.
You got that?

480
00:31:17,424 --> 00:31:19,153
Okay, so she turns...

481
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,360
the first mate
is staggering towards her.

482
00:31:23,697 --> 00:31:26,291
There's a knife
sticking out of his back.

483
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:29,301
Wait a sec.
We're killing off the first mate?

484
00:31:29,836 --> 00:31:32,031
That's assuming she knows
who the first mate is.

485
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:34,938
Come on, Jack.
It was an honest mistake.

486
00:31:35,008 --> 00:31:37,568
Ann is nearsighted.
It could have happened to anyone.

487
00:31:37,644 --> 00:31:39,236
I was joking, Carl.

488
00:31:39,312 --> 00:31:42,611
The point is, she's horrified.
She has to look away.

489
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:47,445
And that's when she sees it.

490
00:31:49,623 --> 00:31:50,988
Sees what?

491
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:53,351
What?

492
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:00,264
The island.

493
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,373
We're filming on an island
now? When did this happen?

494
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:11,543
Jack, keep your voice down.

495
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:14,606
I don't want the crew
getting spooked.

496
00:32:15,181 --> 00:32:18,207
Why would they get spooked?
What's it called?

497
00:32:18,285 --> 00:32:20,310
All right.
It has a local name...

498
00:32:20,387 --> 00:32:22,912
but I'm warning you, Jack,
it doesn't sound good.

499
00:32:22,989 --> 00:32:25,685
They call it Skull Island.

500
00:32:25,825 --> 00:32:27,486
Did you get that?

501
00:32:28,295 --> 00:32:29,626
What's wrong with this place?

502
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,426
There's nothing
officially wrong with it.

503
00:32:32,632 --> 00:32:35,999
Because, technically,
it hasn't been discovered yet.

504
00:32:38,405 --> 00:32:40,373
Okay. All right.

505
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:44,839
So we arrive at this place.

506
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:46,639
S...

507
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,474
K...

508
00:32:49,516 --> 00:32:50,881
U...

509
00:32:51,885 --> 00:32:53,079
L...

510
00:32:54,587 --> 00:32:55,849
L...

511
00:33:01,328 --> 00:33:02,693
Island.

512
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,094
All right, everyone,
from the top! And action!

513
00:33:11,671 --> 00:33:15,334
I think this is awfully exciting!
I've never been on a ship before.

514
00:33:15,408 --> 00:33:18,002
And I've never been on one
with a woman before.

515
00:33:18,078 --> 00:33:21,536
I guess you don't think
much of women on ships, do you?

516
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:23,576
No, they're a nuisance.

517
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:27,313
Well, I'll try not to be.
Just being around is trouble.

518
00:33:35,595 --> 00:33:36,653
Cut!

519
00:33:37,764 --> 00:33:39,129
It's great.

520
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:43,497
Bruce, wonderful performance.
You can relax for 10 minutes.

521
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,471
That was very natural.
I felt moved.

522
00:33:46,606 --> 00:33:50,098
What do you think, Driscoll?
Dialogue's got some flow now, huh?

523
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:52,007
It was pure effluence.

524
00:33:52,078 --> 00:33:53,841
I beefed up the banter.

525
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:56,040
Try to resist that impulse.

526
00:33:56,649 --> 00:33:58,344
It's just a little bit
of humor, bud.

527
00:33:58,418 --> 00:34:00,886
What are you,
a Bolshevik or something?

528
00:34:00,954 --> 00:34:02,148
Actors.

529
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:06,588
Travel the world,
but all they ever see is a mirror.

530
00:34:19,072 --> 00:34:20,403
Good legs.

531
00:34:22,075 --> 00:34:24,669
Sea legs.
Well, you know, sea legs.

532
00:34:27,247 --> 00:34:28,271
Yeah.

533
00:34:28,348 --> 00:34:31,977
Not that you don't have good legs.
Just making conversation.

534
00:34:32,052 --> 00:34:34,350
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

535
00:34:36,322 --> 00:34:38,847
About the scene today
with you and Bruce...

536
00:34:38,925 --> 00:34:40,756
I know it wasn't
what you wrote...

537
00:34:40,827 --> 00:34:44,854
but Mr. Baxter felt very strongly
that when a man likes a woman...

538
00:34:45,498 --> 00:34:47,159
he must ignore her.

539
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:50,100
And if things turn
really hostile, then...

540
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,164
No?

541
00:34:52,238 --> 00:34:53,967
Interesting theory.

542
00:34:54,674 --> 00:34:56,699
I know. I should have...

543
00:34:56,843 --> 00:34:59,073
It wasn't
what I had intended, but...

544
00:34:59,145 --> 00:35:00,669
I'm sorry. I was...

545
00:35:00,747 --> 00:35:02,738
And you made it your own.

546
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:05,206
I was nervous.

547
00:35:05,418 --> 00:35:08,046
It was funny, actually.
You were funny.

548
00:35:08,988 --> 00:35:11,286
Please don't say
another word. Good night.

549
00:35:11,357 --> 00:35:12,756
Miss Darrow.

550
00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:20,593
You don't have to be nervous.

551
00:36:31,137 --> 00:36:32,468
Thank you.

552
00:36:33,373 --> 00:36:35,000
Let's take it...

553
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:37,406
Would you please...
We're trying to shoot a scene.

554
00:36:37,477 --> 00:36:39,104
Okay.
Thank you.

555
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:40,638
Okay, again.

556
00:36:55,195 --> 00:36:57,390
We're close. Turn southwest.

557
00:36:57,864 --> 00:37:01,027
There's no land southwest
for thousands of miles.

558
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:05,494
It takes us way outside
the shipping lanes.

559
00:37:05,572 --> 00:37:08,063
I won't sail blind
in these waters.

560
00:37:09,108 --> 00:37:11,338
I'll make it worth your while.

561
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:14,670
There's nothing out there.

562
00:37:15,381 --> 00:37:17,815
Well, then you've nothing to lose.

563
00:37:29,862 --> 00:37:33,821
If someone were to tell you
this ship was headed for Singapore...

564
00:37:35,301 --> 00:37:37,030
what would you say?

565
00:37:37,136 --> 00:37:39,900
I would say they're
full of it, Mr. Hayes.

566
00:37:41,874 --> 00:37:44,399
Well, we turned southwest last night.

567
00:37:44,611 --> 00:37:46,272
Gentlemen, please.

568
00:37:47,714 --> 00:37:50,205
We're not looking for trouble.
No.

569
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:53,951
You're looking
for something else.

570
00:37:57,323 --> 00:37:58,722
Yes, we are.

571
00:38:00,393 --> 00:38:02,759
We're going to find
Skull Island.

572
00:38:03,363 --> 00:38:06,196
Find it, film it,
and show it to the world.

573
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,966
For 25 cents, you get to see
the last blank space on the map.

574
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:13,566
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

575
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:17,502
What do you mean?

576
00:38:18,244 --> 00:38:20,838
Seven years ago, me and
Mr. Hayes were working our passage...

577
00:38:20,913 --> 00:38:22,471
on a Norwegian bark.

578
00:38:22,548 --> 00:38:25,381
We picked up a castaway.
We found him in the water.

579
00:38:25,652 --> 00:38:27,483
He'd been drifting for days.

580
00:38:27,553 --> 00:38:30,954
His ship had run aground
on an island way west of Sumatra.

581
00:38:31,024 --> 00:38:34,482
An island hidden in fog.

582
00:38:36,262 --> 00:38:38,526
He spoke of a huge wall...

583
00:38:39,799 --> 00:38:41,562
built so long ago...

584
00:38:42,068 --> 00:38:44,093
no one knew who'd made it.

585
00:38:44,337 --> 00:38:47,238
A wall 100 foot high...

586
00:38:47,507 --> 00:38:50,340
as strong today
as it was ages ago.

587
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:54,102
Why'd they build the wall?

588
00:38:58,551 --> 00:39:02,214
Well, the castaway,
he spoke of a creature...

589
00:39:02,655 --> 00:39:04,748
neither beast nor man...

590
00:39:05,258 --> 00:39:08,523
but something monstrous,
living behind that wall.

591
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:10,922
A lion or a tiger.

592
00:39:11,898 --> 00:39:14,196
A man-eater. That's how
all these stories start.

593
00:39:14,267 --> 00:39:16,064
What else did he say?

594
00:39:16,402 --> 00:39:17,528
Nothing.

595
00:39:17,603 --> 00:39:20,367
We found him the next morning.
He'd stuck a knife through his heart.

596
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,702
Mmm-hmm.

597
00:39:21,874 --> 00:39:24,934
Sorry, fellows.
You'll have to do better than that.

598
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:28,443
Monsters belong in B movies.

599
00:39:28,514 --> 00:39:30,539
If you find this place...

600
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:34,486
if you go ashore with your
friends and your cameras...

601
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:37,350
you won't come back.

602
00:39:38,324 --> 00:39:40,849
Just as long as
you understand that.

603
00:41:00,706 --> 00:41:03,573
How long do you expect us
to stay out here?

604
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:11,412
You're writing a stage comedy?

605
00:41:11,551 --> 00:41:13,451
I'm writing it for you.

606
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:17,486
Why would you do that?

607
00:41:18,424 --> 00:41:21,291
Why would I write a play for you?
Yes.

608
00:41:22,929 --> 00:41:24,556
Isn't it obvious?

609
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,631
Not to me.

610
00:41:32,472 --> 00:41:33,666
Well...

611
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:37,005
it's in the subtext.

612
00:41:39,745 --> 00:41:41,975
I guess
I must have missed it.

613
00:41:47,086 --> 00:41:48,883
It's not about words.

614
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:34,022
Message for you, Captain.

615
00:42:52,418 --> 00:42:54,045
What's going on?

616
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,653
Hayes,
why are we changing course?

617
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:01,489
Englehorn, you can't just...
Outside.

618
00:43:05,565 --> 00:43:08,159
There's a warrant out
for your arrest.

619
00:43:08,501 --> 00:43:10,128
Did you know that?

620
00:43:12,572 --> 00:43:15,200
I've been ordered
to divert to Rangoon.

621
00:43:19,378 --> 00:43:22,677
Another week.
I haven't got a film yet.

622
00:43:23,983 --> 00:43:26,747
Please. I have risked
everything I have on this.

623
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:30,084
No, Denham.
You risked everything I have.

624
00:43:31,991 --> 00:43:33,253
What do you want?

625
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:35,590
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything.

626
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:37,595
I want you off my ship.

627
00:43:40,132 --> 00:43:42,657
Set a course for Rangoon,
Mr. Hayes.

628
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:50,742
I'm finished.

629
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:54,076
It's over for me, Jack.

630
00:43:55,815 --> 00:43:58,306
How'd you think
this would end, Carl?

631
00:44:14,033 --> 00:44:17,469
Check our position.
Use the stars.

632
00:44:31,117 --> 00:44:33,244
There are no stars, Captain.

633
00:44:35,688 --> 00:44:37,087
What is that?

634
00:44:39,058 --> 00:44:41,151
What?
That.

635
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:46,792
That right there.

636
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:50,597
I don't know.
What is it? A coffee stain?

637
00:46:28,934 --> 00:46:32,768
Station the forward lookout
and get me the depth by lead line.

638
00:46:33,072 --> 00:46:34,539
Aye, Captain.

639
00:46:45,851 --> 00:46:47,978
30 fathoms, no bottom!

640
00:46:49,822 --> 00:46:52,791
Reduce speed,
steerage way only.

641
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:55,424
Dead slow ahead, both.

642
00:46:58,464 --> 00:47:00,455
You should stop the ship.

643
00:47:01,834 --> 00:47:03,631
15 degrees port.

644
00:47:06,505 --> 00:47:08,234
We're getting out of here,
Mr. Hayes.

645
00:47:08,307 --> 00:47:10,434
We'll find clear conditions.

646
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,634
We have seabed!

647
00:47:18,384 --> 00:47:19,874
25 fathoms!

648
00:47:21,754 --> 00:47:23,221
We're shallowing!

649
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:24,654
20 degrees starboard!

650
00:47:24,723 --> 00:47:26,782
Captain, you don't know
where the hell you're going!

651
00:47:26,859 --> 00:47:28,486
Get me another reading!

652
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:33,322
Another reading!

653
00:47:35,868 --> 00:47:37,597
22 fathoms!

654
00:47:39,138 --> 00:47:41,197
Douse the lights.
Aye, Captain.

655
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:54,618
10 fathoms!

656
00:48:06,198 --> 00:48:08,996
Wall! There's a wall ahead!

657
00:48:26,252 --> 00:48:27,742
Stop engines!

658
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,847
Give me some power!
Half astern both.

659
00:49:32,918 --> 00:49:35,011
Half astern both, Captain!

660
00:49:39,591 --> 00:49:40,785
Rocks!

661
00:49:43,896 --> 00:49:45,056
Rocks!

662
00:49:49,635 --> 00:49:51,796
Rocks to starboard, Captain!

663
00:49:52,304 --> 00:49:54,670
To port! Rocks everywhere!

664
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,432
Take the wheel, Hayes.

665
00:50:13,592 --> 00:50:14,820
Hang on!

666
00:50:38,283 --> 00:50:39,648
Full ahead!

667
00:50:45,457 --> 00:50:47,357
Rocks to port, Captain!

668
00:50:48,327 --> 00:50:51,091
Turn, Captain!
Starboard, starboard!

669
00:51:10,549 --> 00:51:11,811
Ah!

670
00:52:18,517 --> 00:52:20,109
Shore up that breach!

671
00:52:20,185 --> 00:52:23,450
Get me more men down here now!
Come on, move, move!

672
00:52:25,491 --> 00:52:27,789
Hayes!
She's taken a pounding!

673
00:52:30,062 --> 00:52:31,495
What about the prop?

674
00:52:31,563 --> 00:52:33,758
The shaft's not bent,
as far as we can tell.

675
00:52:33,832 --> 00:52:36,062
But she struck hard
against the rock!

676
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:38,297
Captain!

677
00:52:38,971 --> 00:52:40,734
Better come up quick!

678
00:52:42,608 --> 00:52:44,007
Right there!

679
00:52:58,824 --> 00:53:00,917
Want me to bring them back?

680
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,255
I don't give a damn
about Carl Denham.

681
00:53:03,328 --> 00:53:06,820
I want this ship fixed and ready
to float on the next high tide!

682
00:53:06,899 --> 00:53:08,526
Come on, move it.

683
00:53:09,701 --> 00:53:11,692
We're leaving, Mr. Hayes.

684
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:21,204
Can you believe this, Jack?

685
00:53:24,516 --> 00:53:26,381
We've got our picture.

686
00:54:24,009 --> 00:54:26,705
Why does Marlow
keep going up the river?

687
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,071
Why doesn't he turn back?

688
00:54:32,517 --> 00:54:35,350
There's a part of him
that wants to, Jimmy.

689
00:54:36,688 --> 00:54:39,851
A part deep inside himself
that sounds a warning.

690
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,753
But there's another part...

691
00:54:44,896 --> 00:54:46,625
that needs to know.

692
00:54:49,868 --> 00:54:52,701
To defeat the thing
which makes him afraid.

693
00:54:54,573 --> 00:54:57,872
"We could not understand
because we were too far...

694
00:54:58,744 --> 00:54:59,938
<i>"and could not remember...</i>

695
00:55:00,012 --> 00:55:03,539
<i>"because we were traveling
in the night of first ages...</i>

696
00:55:04,383 --> 00:55:06,681
<i>"of those ages
that are gone...</i>

697
00:55:07,886 --> 00:55:10,582
<i>"leaving hardly a sign,
and no memories.</i>

698
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:14,686
<i>"We are accustomed to look...</i>

699
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,923
<i>"upon the shackled form
of a conquered monster...</i>

700
00:55:20,399 --> 00:55:21,889
<i>"but there...</i>

701
00:55:23,268 --> 00:55:27,034
<i>"there you could look
at a thing monstrous and free."</i>

702
00:55:37,049 --> 00:55:39,279
It's not
an adventure story...

703
00:55:39,851 --> 00:55:41,478
is it, Mr. Hayes?

704
00:55:43,488 --> 00:55:44,819
No, Jimmy.

705
00:55:45,924 --> 00:55:47,323
It's not.

706
00:56:09,815 --> 00:56:12,215
It's deserted.
Of course it's deserted.

707
00:56:12,284 --> 00:56:15,720
Use your eyes, Preston.
The place is a ruin.

708
00:56:17,155 --> 00:56:19,953
Nobody's lived here
for hundreds of years.

709
00:57:33,832 --> 00:57:36,323
Mr. Denham,
I think we should go back.

710
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:38,130
I will handle this.

711
00:57:43,575 --> 00:57:45,202
Look. Chocolate.

712
00:57:46,445 --> 00:57:48,174
You like chocolate?

713
00:57:50,982 --> 00:57:52,643
It's good to eat.

714
00:57:54,986 --> 00:57:56,248
You want?

715
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:03,488
Take it.

716
00:58:11,236 --> 00:58:13,602
Here, put it in your hand
and take it.

717
00:58:19,678 --> 00:58:22,112
For God's sakes, Denham,
leave the native alone.

718
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:24,478
She doesn't want
the chocolate.

719
00:58:26,451 --> 00:58:27,679
Aah!

720
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:51,073
All right!

721
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:53,934
Just a bunch of women
and old folks!

722
00:58:55,747 --> 00:58:57,374
They're harmless!

723
01:00:19,097 --> 01:00:20,155
Ann!

724
01:01:47,652 --> 01:01:48,744
Jack.

725
01:02:02,967 --> 01:02:04,366
Seen enough?

726
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:13,871
Lighten the ship!

727
01:02:14,379 --> 01:02:18,042
Anything that's not
bolted down goes overboard!

728
01:02:20,385 --> 01:02:21,875
Just heave it!

729
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,648
We got away.

730
01:02:23,722 --> 01:02:25,451
We gotta be grateful
for that, gentlemen.

731
01:02:25,523 --> 01:02:29,289
What about Mike?
He didn't get away! He's still there!

732
01:02:29,994 --> 01:02:33,293
Mike died doing what he believed in!
He didn't die for nothing.

733
01:02:33,364 --> 01:02:37,425
And I'll tell you something else.
I'm gonna finish this film for Mike!

734
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:45,502
I'll finish it...

735
01:02:47,412 --> 01:02:49,710
and I'll donate the proceeds...

736
01:02:50,415 --> 01:02:52,212
to his wife and kids.

737
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:56,211
Because that man is a hero,
and he deserves nothing less.

738
01:02:57,055 --> 01:02:58,420
Hear, hear!

739
01:03:36,928 --> 01:03:39,328
Chuck everything
except for the potatoes!

740
01:03:44,869 --> 01:03:47,702
What's wrong now?
Excuse me, Shakespeare.

741
01:03:48,206 --> 01:03:50,572
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!

742
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:05,221
Drop those spare cables overboard!
Go on, just chuck it!

743
01:04:23,641 --> 01:04:24,801
Where's Ann?
What?

744
01:04:24,876 --> 01:04:26,036
Where's Ann?

745
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:32,405
Ann!

746
01:04:52,203 --> 01:04:53,534
She's free!

747
01:04:59,878 --> 01:05:02,472
Full ahead, both engines!

748
01:05:09,754 --> 01:05:11,187
Ann!

749
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:36,679
No! Stop! Turn back!

750
01:05:38,016 --> 01:05:39,244
Stop!

751
01:05:41,152 --> 01:05:42,949
We have to turn back.

752
01:05:43,154 --> 01:05:44,815
They've taken Ann.

753
01:05:57,235 --> 01:06:00,329
Kong! Kong! Kong!

754
01:06:42,513 --> 01:06:46,415
All hands going ashore!
Report to stations!

755
01:06:47,719 --> 01:06:50,153
Jump to it!
Jump to it, gentlemen!

756
01:06:53,825 --> 01:06:55,554
We're doing it, Mr. Hayes!

757
01:07:02,867 --> 01:07:04,630
Come on, move it!

758
01:07:21,652 --> 01:07:23,313
Pull harder!

759
01:07:24,655 --> 01:07:26,555
Row! Row!

760
01:07:26,758 --> 01:07:27,952
Come on!

761
01:08:14,772 --> 01:08:15,898
Kong.

762
01:10:38,282 --> 01:10:40,079
Spread out! Find her!

763
01:10:48,893 --> 01:10:50,258
Miss Darrow!

764
01:10:50,461 --> 01:10:53,259
Check up there, Jimmy!
Everybody stay together!

765
01:10:56,701 --> 01:10:57,725
Ann!

766
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:01,633
She's here somewhere!

767
01:11:06,344 --> 01:11:08,175
What in God's name was that?

768
01:11:14,552 --> 01:11:16,144
Behind the wall!

769
01:11:16,887 --> 01:11:18,479
Behind the wall!

770
01:12:10,141 --> 01:12:11,506
She's gone!

771
01:12:22,486 --> 01:12:24,249
Carl, what is it?

772
01:12:30,895 --> 01:12:32,556
You saw something.

773
01:12:39,737 --> 01:12:42,535
You can take Hayes
and 15 others.

774
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:46,004
I'll put a guard on the gate
until you return.

775
01:12:46,077 --> 01:12:48,568
The rest of you
stay with the ship.

776
01:12:48,679 --> 01:12:49,771
Choy!

777
01:12:51,549 --> 01:12:53,107
Not you, Jimmy.

778
01:12:53,217 --> 01:12:55,344
Come on, Mr. Hayes.
Look at them.

779
01:12:55,419 --> 01:12:57,182
None of them knows
which way to point a gun.

780
01:12:57,254 --> 01:12:58,585
Stay here.

781
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:01,558
Miss Darrow needs me! No!

782
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:08,796
Bring the tripod
and all of the film stock.

783
01:13:08,866 --> 01:13:11,300
You wanna go
with the 6-inch lens?

784
01:13:11,769 --> 01:13:14,169
The wide-angle
will do just fine.

785
01:13:20,177 --> 01:13:23,112
You got guns. You got food.
You got the ammo.

786
01:13:23,581 --> 01:13:25,378
And you got 24 hours!

787
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:27,283
24 hours?

788
01:13:27,518 --> 01:13:29,679
This time tomorrow,
we haul anchor.

789
01:13:53,144 --> 01:13:54,668
Miss Darrow!

790
01:13:57,047 --> 01:13:58,173
Ann!

791
01:14:01,585 --> 01:14:02,984
Miss Darrow!

792
01:14:11,896 --> 01:14:13,295
Miss Darrow!

793
01:14:18,335 --> 01:14:19,734
Miss Darrow!

794
01:14:24,442 --> 01:14:25,500
Ann!

795
01:15:41,051 --> 01:15:42,040
No!

796
01:15:59,770 --> 01:16:01,965
Ann!
Miss Darrow!

797
01:16:10,581 --> 01:16:11,639
Ann!

798
01:16:59,096 --> 01:17:01,496
Christ,
it's a bleeding bone yard!

799
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:05,368
They've been ripped
limb from limb.

800
01:17:07,204 --> 01:17:09,638
Ann! Ann!

801
01:17:22,886 --> 01:17:25,150
Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes.
Pretend you didn't see me.

802
01:17:25,222 --> 01:17:27,213
Jesus, Jimmy.
Hey, I need that!

803
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:28,519
I'm not giving you a gun!

804
01:17:28,592 --> 01:17:30,617
You were younger than me
when they gave you one!

805
01:17:30,694 --> 01:17:34,255
I was in the army.
I was trained. I had a drill sergeant.

806
01:17:35,733 --> 01:17:37,860
I wanna help bring her back.

807
01:17:45,709 --> 01:17:47,677
Don't make me regret it.

808
01:18:15,005 --> 01:18:16,996
Conserve your ammunition!

809
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:27,840
I'm knackered.

810
01:18:30,154 --> 01:18:32,213
I can't breathe.
I need a breather.

811
01:18:32,289 --> 01:18:33,756
Fellows, we don't
have time for this.

812
01:18:33,824 --> 01:18:36,292
We've lost too much ground
already. Come on, get up!

813
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:39,796
They're not about to quit on you.
Cut them some slack.

814
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:42,262
All right,
you got five minutes!

815
01:18:42,499 --> 01:18:44,433
Everybody stay in sight.

816
01:18:48,439 --> 01:18:51,875
Over here. I'm gonna get
a wide shot of the valley.

817
01:19:22,106 --> 01:19:23,471
Bloody Nora!

818
01:19:30,614 --> 01:19:32,844
Is that
what took Miss Darrow?

819
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:40,550
There's only one creature capable
of leaving a footprint that size.

820
01:19:46,997 --> 01:19:48,897
The abominable snowman.

821
01:19:50,501 --> 01:19:53,197
Yeah, a snowman.
We dead meat.

822
01:19:53,904 --> 01:19:56,304
It's got to be what,
20, 25 feet?

823
01:19:58,408 --> 01:19:59,841
Carl saw it.

824
01:20:01,245 --> 01:20:02,735
Let's ask him.

825
01:20:04,848 --> 01:20:06,042
Denham!

826
01:20:08,619 --> 01:20:09,881
Where'd he go?

827
01:20:30,107 --> 01:20:31,870
Walk forward, Bruce.

828
01:20:32,409 --> 01:20:34,206
What?
You're the star
of this picture.

829
01:20:34,278 --> 01:20:37,338
Get into character
and head toward the animals.

830
01:20:43,487 --> 01:20:46,081
What the hell
kind of a place is this?

831
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,632
Are you sure about this, Denham?

832
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:01,195
Don't we have a stand-in
for this type of thing?

833
01:21:01,271 --> 01:21:04,206
I need you in the shot,
or people will say they're fake.

834
01:21:04,274 --> 01:21:06,469
Nobody's gonna think
these are fake.

835
01:21:15,152 --> 01:21:17,143
You're making them nervous.
No sudden movements.

836
01:21:17,221 --> 01:21:18,518
I'm not moving.

837
01:21:24,294 --> 01:21:26,626
Mother of God.

838
01:21:48,585 --> 01:21:49,950
What's this?

839
01:22:16,179 --> 01:22:17,646
What is it? What is it?
Where's Carl?

840
01:22:17,714 --> 01:22:20,512
Carl?
He's up there, filming.

841
01:22:30,961 --> 01:22:32,360
Bugger this!

842
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:41,567
Run, Jack!

843
01:22:44,374 --> 01:22:46,899
Holy Christ.
Go, Jimmy, run!

844
01:22:47,811 --> 01:22:49,301
Run, run, run!

845
01:22:56,186 --> 01:22:57,778
Let go!
I'm not leaving the camera!

846
01:22:57,854 --> 01:22:59,151
Let go, you idiot!

847
01:22:59,222 --> 01:23:01,053
Carl, run!

848
01:23:14,504 --> 01:23:15,766
Get down.

849
01:23:16,606 --> 01:23:17,630
Look out!

850
01:24:07,924 --> 01:24:09,448
Coming through!

851
01:25:13,757 --> 01:25:14,781
No!

852
01:25:57,868 --> 01:26:00,598
Carl! Carl!

853
01:26:03,773 --> 01:26:06,298
Get up! Come on. Come on.

854
01:26:21,158 --> 01:26:23,820
Mr. Denham! Mr. Denham!

855
01:26:24,528 --> 01:26:27,122
Herb! Herb, come on!

856
01:26:27,197 --> 01:26:28,926
Take the tripod!

857
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:30,394
Come on!

858
01:26:31,601 --> 01:26:34,161
I'm pulling you up!
Hold on to your end!

859
01:26:34,237 --> 01:26:35,261
Go!

860
01:26:35,338 --> 01:26:37,033
No, I'm not going anywhere
without you!

861
01:26:37,707 --> 01:26:40,369
You gotta leave me!
Shut up and hold on!

862
01:27:48,111 --> 01:27:49,840
Jimmy, do a head count.

863
01:27:49,913 --> 01:27:52,438
I want to know how many
are injured and how bad.

864
01:27:52,515 --> 01:27:53,777
Injured?

865
01:27:55,185 --> 01:27:56,948
Four of us are dead!

866
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:05,423
It's not your fault.

867
01:28:05,862 --> 01:28:08,558
What happened to Herb
is no one's fault.

868
01:28:09,032 --> 01:28:11,432
You're absolutely right, Preston.

869
01:28:11,835 --> 01:28:14,235
And I'll tell you
something else.

870
01:28:14,304 --> 01:28:16,602
Herbert didn't die
for nothing.

871
01:28:17,007 --> 01:28:19,805
He died for what he believed in,
and I'm gonna honor that.

872
01:28:19,876 --> 01:28:23,937
He died believing there was still
some mystery left in this world.

873
01:28:24,414 --> 01:28:27,008
And we could all
have a piece of it...

874
01:28:27,217 --> 01:28:29,742
for the price
of an admission ticket.

875
01:28:29,986 --> 01:28:33,683
God damn it, Preston,
we're gonna finish this film for Herb.

876
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:35,751
We'll finish it...

877
01:28:35,859 --> 01:28:38,760
and donate the proceeds
to his wife and kids.

878
01:28:40,397 --> 01:28:42,388
All right, we gotta
get back to the ship.

879
01:28:42,465 --> 01:28:46,162
Englehorn sails in nine hours.
So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.

880
01:28:46,236 --> 01:28:48,704
Hey, do you hear me?
We're gonna be stranded here.

881
01:28:48,772 --> 01:28:52,173
Look, fellows,
Miss Darrow was a great gal, no question.

882
01:28:52,242 --> 01:28:53,971
And she was
a wonderful person.

883
01:28:54,044 --> 01:28:57,275
It's a terrible loss
and we're all gonna miss her.

884
01:28:57,580 --> 01:29:01,482
I always knew you were nothing like
the tough guy you play on screen.

885
01:29:01,551 --> 01:29:03,280
I just never figured you
for a coward.

886
01:29:03,353 --> 01:29:05,480
Hey, pal! Hey, wake up.

887
01:29:06,022 --> 01:29:08,490
Heroes don't look like me,
not in the real world.

888
01:29:08,558 --> 01:29:12,119
In the real world, they got bad teeth,
a bald spot, and a beer gut.

889
01:29:12,195 --> 01:29:15,722
I'm just an actor with a gun,
who's lost his motivation.

890
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:18,657
Be seeing you.

891
01:29:19,903 --> 01:29:21,268
Anyone else?

892
01:29:22,806 --> 01:29:24,774
Well, see you.
Come on.

893
01:34:21,504 --> 01:34:22,698
No!

894
01:34:23,406 --> 01:34:24,839
I said no!

895
01:34:32,315 --> 01:34:35,876
That's all there is.
There isn't any more.

896
01:36:32,902 --> 01:36:34,028
What is it?

897
01:36:38,808 --> 01:36:40,105
Mr. Hayes?

898
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:46,273
If anything happens,
I want you to run.

899
01:36:46,783 --> 01:36:48,045
You understand?

900
01:36:48,618 --> 01:36:51,587
I'm not a coward.
I ain't gonna run.

901
01:36:53,122 --> 01:36:55,090
It's not about
being brave, Jimmy.

902
01:37:23,719 --> 01:37:24,743
Go back!

903
01:37:26,789 --> 01:37:28,188
Back across the log!

904
01:37:28,391 --> 01:37:30,951
I ain't gonna run!
Get Jimmy out of here!

905
01:37:31,194 --> 01:37:32,491
No!
Get back! Get back!

906
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:38,731
Move back!

907
01:37:51,681 --> 01:37:53,945
No! No!
Stay back.

908
01:37:56,652 --> 01:37:57,710
No!

909
01:38:02,992 --> 01:38:04,289
Look at me.

910
01:38:06,529 --> 01:38:09,089
Let him go!
You got to run, Jimmy.

911
01:38:13,269 --> 01:38:14,634
Do as I say.

912
01:38:15,972 --> 01:38:17,371
Go with Jack.

913
01:38:19,809 --> 01:38:20,867
Run!

914
01:38:24,413 --> 01:38:26,813
No! Shoot him!

915
01:38:28,351 --> 01:38:29,340
No!

916
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,198
Here! Over here!

917
01:39:05,321 --> 01:39:07,289
Hold on! Hold on!

918
01:39:11,394 --> 01:39:13,658
Lumpy! Help me!

919
01:39:15,898 --> 01:39:17,297
Bloody hell, Choy!

920
01:44:39,255 --> 01:44:40,313
No!

921
01:44:44,493 --> 01:44:45,687
Oh, my!

922
01:51:21,156 --> 01:51:22,453
Wait!

923
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:13,066
Carl.

924
01:52:18,146 --> 01:52:19,738
Jimmy. Jimmy.

925
01:52:20,615 --> 01:52:21,604
Jimmy.

926
01:52:22,718 --> 01:52:23,878
You all right?

927
01:53:13,835 --> 01:53:15,097
No.

928
01:54:07,355 --> 01:54:09,380
Get off! Get it off!

929
01:54:16,932 --> 01:54:17,956
Get off!

930
01:54:31,847 --> 01:54:32,939
Get it off!

931
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,006
Kill it!

932
01:55:52,093 --> 01:55:53,492
Stop moving!

933
01:56:13,548 --> 01:56:15,277
Get it off my face!

934
01:56:16,251 --> 01:56:18,651
Stay still.
I am standing still.

935
01:56:21,156 --> 01:56:22,953
Hold on.
Be careful!

936
01:56:57,792 --> 01:57:00,420
Don't move!
Stay away from the walls!

937
01:57:01,096 --> 01:57:02,620
Coming through!

938
01:57:11,072 --> 01:57:13,666
Get out of there now! Climb!

939
02:00:04,846 --> 02:00:06,370
It's beautiful.

940
02:00:27,835 --> 02:00:29,166
Beautiful.

941
02:00:40,648 --> 02:00:41,979
Beautiful.

942
02:01:29,397 --> 02:01:30,591
There.

943
02:01:33,668 --> 02:01:34,760
Thank God.

944
02:01:34,836 --> 02:01:36,804
Don't thank God.
Thank Mr. Baxter.

945
02:01:36,904 --> 02:01:38,872
He insisted on
a rescue mission.

946
02:01:40,208 --> 02:01:43,666
Me? I knew you'd be okay.

947
02:01:44,979 --> 02:01:47,243
That's the thing
about cockroaches.

948
02:01:47,315 --> 02:01:50,751
No matter how many times
you flush them down the toilet...

949
02:01:50,818 --> 02:01:53,309
they always crawl
back up the bowl.

950
02:01:54,255 --> 02:01:57,088
Hey, buddy?
I'm out of the bowl.

951
02:01:57,859 --> 02:02:00,521
I'm dryin' off my wings
and trekkin' across the lid.

952
02:02:08,469 --> 02:02:09,697
Driscoll!

953
02:02:11,172 --> 02:02:14,835
Don't be a fool!
Give it up. It's useless!

954
02:02:16,110 --> 02:02:17,475
She's dead.

955
02:02:20,281 --> 02:02:21,839
She's not dead.

956
02:02:25,753 --> 02:02:27,983
Jack's gonna bring her back...

957
02:02:28,956 --> 02:02:31,550
and the ape will be
hard on his heels.

958
02:02:32,260 --> 02:02:34,785
We can still
come out of this thing okay.

959
02:02:37,398 --> 02:02:38,956
More than okay.

960
02:02:40,201 --> 02:02:41,759
Think about it.

961
02:02:41,836 --> 02:02:44,669
You got a boat full of chloroform
we could put to good use.

962
02:02:45,606 --> 02:02:47,506
You wanna trap the ape?

963
02:02:54,349 --> 02:02:55,976
I don't think so.

964
02:02:56,551 --> 02:02:59,987
Isn't that what you do?
Live animal capture?

965
02:03:01,489 --> 02:03:03,252
I heard you were the best.

966
02:03:11,366 --> 02:03:12,492
Jack!

967
02:03:15,570 --> 02:03:17,333
Look after yourself!

968
02:03:17,972 --> 02:03:19,599
Keep the gate open, will you?

969
02:03:19,974 --> 02:03:21,373
Sure thing, buddy.

970
02:03:22,410 --> 02:03:23,741
Good luck!

971
02:03:37,024 --> 02:03:38,389
I'm sorry.

972
02:06:17,251 --> 02:06:18,309
Ann.

973
02:07:26,854 --> 02:07:27,946
Jack!

974
02:07:28,823 --> 02:07:29,915
Run!

975
02:08:00,221 --> 02:08:01,848
Jack, Jack!

976
02:08:09,563 --> 02:08:10,723
Jack.

977
02:08:19,774 --> 02:08:21,742
Ann, it's okay.

978
02:08:22,576 --> 02:08:24,976
Ann, let's go.
Let's go. Come on!

979
02:08:38,259 --> 02:08:39,624
Let's go. Come on.

980
02:08:40,361 --> 02:08:41,589
Come on!

981
02:10:13,854 --> 02:10:14,946
Carl!

982
02:10:15,122 --> 02:10:17,818
Please! Somebody help us!

983
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:21,427
They've gone.

984
02:10:22,997 --> 02:10:25,056
Carl. Christ.

985
02:10:25,633 --> 02:10:26,725
Carl!

986
02:10:27,568 --> 02:10:29,729
Drop the bridge.
Do it now, for Christ's sake!

987
02:10:29,804 --> 02:10:31,032
Not yet.

988
02:10:32,473 --> 02:10:33,565
Wait.

989
02:10:34,241 --> 02:10:35,333
Wait.

990
02:10:39,480 --> 02:10:40,572
Wait!

991
02:10:51,292 --> 02:10:52,520
Come on!

992
02:12:04,999 --> 02:12:06,489
Now!
Throw them!

993
02:12:06,567 --> 02:12:07,966
Throw!

994
02:12:08,836 --> 02:12:09,860
No!

995
02:12:12,239 --> 02:12:13,467
Hold him!

996
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:15,030
Are you out of your mind?

997
02:12:23,751 --> 02:12:25,878
Stop!
Hold the line!

998
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:28,019
Keep him down!

999
02:12:33,594 --> 02:12:34,583
Heave!

1000
02:12:35,629 --> 02:12:36,960
Please!

1001
02:12:37,431 --> 02:12:39,126
No! Stop!

1002
02:12:39,466 --> 02:12:40,455
Jack.

1003
02:12:41,535 --> 02:12:42,797
No.
Get her out of...

1004
02:12:42,870 --> 02:12:44,770
They'll kill him!
There's nothing we can do.

1005
02:12:44,838 --> 02:12:46,806
No!
Get her out of his sight!

1006
02:12:46,874 --> 02:12:48,808
It's too late. Throw it!

1007
02:12:51,078 --> 02:12:52,170
Look out!

1008
02:12:54,481 --> 02:12:55,948
Let go of me.

1009
02:13:00,087 --> 02:13:01,714
We gotta go. Come on.

1010
02:13:02,289 --> 02:13:03,483
Come on. Stop it.

1011
02:13:03,557 --> 02:13:05,081
Leave me alone!

1012
02:13:06,260 --> 02:13:07,784
Ann, please come on.

1013
02:13:15,102 --> 02:13:16,933
Kill it! No. No!

1014
02:13:17,137 --> 02:13:19,401
It's over,
you goddamn lunatic!

1015
02:13:21,608 --> 02:13:23,132
All of you, run!

1016
02:13:23,210 --> 02:13:24,575
Come on. Come on!

1017
02:13:32,753 --> 02:13:34,380
Move it! Move it!

1018
02:13:36,757 --> 02:13:38,122
Come on, come on!

1019
02:13:47,034 --> 02:13:48,661
Stay there!
It's me he wants!

1020
02:13:48,736 --> 02:13:50,931
Please stop this!
Move! Hold onto her!

1021
02:13:51,005 --> 02:13:53,667
Ann, go.
Please, I can stop this!

1022
02:13:53,741 --> 02:13:55,265
No! Ann, stay there!

1023
02:13:57,745 --> 02:13:59,144
Get it out!

1024
02:14:01,882 --> 02:14:03,747
Get the hell out of here!

1025
02:14:03,817 --> 02:14:05,808
Come on!
Jimmy, don't be crazy! Come on.

1026
02:14:05,886 --> 02:14:07,183
Don't be crazy.

1027
02:14:08,389 --> 02:14:09,481
Let me go!

1028
02:14:10,824 --> 02:14:12,291
Cast off!

1029
02:14:14,595 --> 02:14:15,857
Come on, Carl!

1030
02:14:17,331 --> 02:14:19,162
Row! Wait.

1031
02:14:19,433 --> 02:14:21,560
Row, God damn it!

1032
02:14:31,812 --> 02:14:32,938
Go back.

1033
02:14:39,853 --> 02:14:40,979
Jimmy, no!

1034
02:14:47,961 --> 02:14:48,950
No!

1035
02:15:06,046 --> 02:15:07,877
No! Don't! Leave him alone!

1036
02:15:07,948 --> 02:15:09,472
Hide out in the back!

1037
02:15:32,039 --> 02:15:33,666
Wait! No!

1038
02:15:34,374 --> 02:15:36,968
No! No! Please don't!

1039
02:17:35,195 --> 02:17:37,720
The whole world
will pay to see this.

1040
02:17:40,467 --> 02:17:42,458
We're millionaires, boys!

1041
02:17:42,769 --> 02:17:44,669
I'll share it with all of you!

1042
02:17:45,505 --> 02:17:49,999
In a few months his name will
be up in lights on Broadway!

1043
02:17:52,179 --> 02:17:56,275
Kong!
The Eighth Wonder of the World!

1044
02:18:59,579 --> 02:19:01,604
What can I say?
What can I say?

1045
02:19:01,682 --> 02:19:03,081
Any comments, sir?

1046
02:19:04,418 --> 02:19:06,045
The Mayor, thank you.

1047
02:19:07,254 --> 02:19:08,243
Ready.

1048
02:19:08,422 --> 02:19:09,753
What am I?

1049
02:19:10,157 --> 02:19:11,886
Thank you very much.

1050
02:19:15,729 --> 02:19:17,219
Get used to it.

1051
02:19:17,431 --> 02:19:19,092
Listen, great to see you.
Ready?

1052
02:19:19,166 --> 02:19:20,633
I'm really appreciating that...

1053
02:19:20,701 --> 02:19:22,168
Look at you!
I remember you.

1054
02:19:22,235 --> 02:19:25,227
You're a lucky guy, Denham.
Am I a lucky guy?

1055
02:19:25,305 --> 02:19:27,102
Maybe you're the lucky guy.

1056
02:19:40,921 --> 02:19:42,081
Carl!

1057
02:19:43,957 --> 02:19:45,151
Zelman! I told you.

1058
02:19:45,225 --> 02:19:46,692
I know you did
and I appreciate it.

1059
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:48,751
Let's get a shot of this.

1060
02:19:49,229 --> 02:19:50,355
Come on.

1061
02:19:51,098 --> 02:19:53,430
Big smile.
Yeah! That's great!

1062
02:19:55,802 --> 02:19:58,737
<i>Look at yourself.
Look at what you've become.</i>

1063
02:19:59,473 --> 02:20:01,998
No woman is worth this.
This woman is worth it.

1064
02:20:02,075 --> 02:20:04,066
I don't care what it takes,
I gotta win her back.

1065
02:20:04,144 --> 02:20:05,372
Oh, really?

1066
02:20:05,445 --> 02:20:07,106
She's not gonna buy
this for a second.

1067
02:20:07,180 --> 02:20:09,375
Shut up and hand me
the grapefruit!

1068
02:20:11,518 --> 02:20:14,180
<i>You're writing a comedy?
Yes, I am.</i>

1069
02:20:14,921 --> 02:20:16,855
<i>I'm writing it for you.</i>

1070
02:20:18,792 --> 02:20:20,657
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

1071
02:20:21,661 --> 02:20:24,061
<i>Why would I write a play for you?</i>

1072
02:20:27,467 --> 02:20:29,094
<i>Isn't it obvious?</i>

1073
02:20:29,369 --> 02:20:30,859
Oh, I'm sorry.

1074
02:20:32,105 --> 02:20:33,970
I couldn't help but overhear.

1075
02:20:37,477 --> 02:20:40,207
So, he took me to this
fancy French restaurant...

1076
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:43,078
and halfway through the
hors d'oeuvres, he clutches my hand.

1077
02:20:43,150 --> 02:20:45,345
And that's when he
told you how he felt?

1078
02:20:45,419 --> 02:20:48,149
No. He never said it.
He never said it?

1079
02:20:48,221 --> 02:20:50,189
He probably thought
he didn't need to say it.

1080
02:20:50,257 --> 02:20:52,282
Well, then how does she know
that it's real?

1081
02:20:52,359 --> 02:20:55,817
He said it was not about the words.
Oh, please!

1082
02:20:56,029 --> 02:21:00,159
If you feel it, you say it.
It's really very simple.

1083
02:21:00,534 --> 02:21:04,834
He said we'd talk about it later.
Only there was no later.

1084
02:21:06,573 --> 02:21:08,131
It never happened.

1085
02:21:09,142 --> 02:21:10,905
That's how it ended.

1086
02:21:11,044 --> 02:21:14,775
He just let you walk away?
He didn't try to save it?

1087
02:21:16,650 --> 02:21:20,017
I honestly believed
things might actually work out...

1088
02:21:21,121 --> 02:21:23,112
which was really very...

1089
02:21:26,393 --> 02:21:27,621
foolish.

1090
02:21:27,861 --> 02:21:30,489
Men.
Oh, they'll give you the world...

1091
02:21:30,564 --> 02:21:32,964
but they let the one thing
that truly matters...

1092
02:21:33,033 --> 02:21:34,933
slip through their fingers.

1093
02:21:35,001 --> 02:21:36,229
Typical.

1094
02:21:36,837 --> 02:21:40,500
They're so busy being brave,
they forget to use their brains.

1095
02:21:41,475 --> 02:21:43,375
Romance. Who needs it?

1096
02:22:08,134 --> 02:22:09,465
Thank you.

1097
02:22:10,303 --> 02:22:11,668
Thank you.

1098
02:22:14,608 --> 02:22:15,939
Thank you.

1099
02:22:17,744 --> 02:22:19,109
Thank you.

1100
02:22:20,914 --> 02:22:22,381
Ladies and gentlemen...

1101
02:22:23,984 --> 02:22:26,475
I'm here to tell you
a very strange story.

1102
02:22:27,254 --> 02:22:28,983
The story of our adventure...

1103
02:22:29,823 --> 02:22:32,792
in which 17 of our party
suffered horrible deaths...

1104
02:22:33,760 --> 02:22:35,250
their lives lost...

1105
02:22:36,029 --> 02:22:38,122
in pursuit of
a savage beast...

1106
02:22:39,299 --> 02:22:41,893
a monstrous aberration of nature.

1107
02:22:43,136 --> 02:22:45,263
But even the meanest
brute can be tamed.

1108
02:22:46,006 --> 02:22:48,304
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
as you will see...

1109
02:22:48,775 --> 02:22:50,436
the beast was no match...

1110
02:22:51,044 --> 02:22:52,602
for the charms of a girl.

1111
02:22:56,082 --> 02:22:57,674
A girl from New York...

1112
02:23:00,887 --> 02:23:02,684
Who melted his heart...

1113
02:23:03,390 --> 02:23:05,984
bringing to mind
that old Arabian proverb...

1114
02:23:07,928 --> 02:23:11,091
"And lo, the beast looked
upon the face of beauty...

1115
02:23:12,132 --> 02:23:14,032
"and beauty stayed his hand.

1116
02:23:15,335 --> 02:23:19,203
"And from that day forward,
he was as one dead."

1117
02:23:26,980 --> 02:23:30,438
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to show you...

1118
02:23:30,584 --> 02:23:33,576
the greatest thing
your eyes have ever beheld.

1119
02:23:34,721 --> 02:23:39,385
He was a king in the world he knew,
but he comes to you now a captive.

1120
02:23:40,594 --> 02:23:42,255
Ladies and gentlemen...

1121
02:23:42,329 --> 02:23:46,857
I give you Kong,
The Eighth Wonder of the World!

1122
02:23:56,242 --> 02:23:59,370
Don't be alarmed.
It's perfectly safe.

1123
02:23:59,679 --> 02:24:03,115
These chains are made
of chrome steel!

1124
02:24:23,870 --> 02:24:25,667
Observe, if you will...

1125
02:24:28,942 --> 02:24:30,910
I am touching the beast.

1126
02:24:31,211 --> 02:24:35,443
I am actually laying my hand
on the 25-foot gorilla.

1127
02:24:42,589 --> 02:24:44,216
Crank 'em up, fellas.

1128
02:25:03,543 --> 02:25:05,738
And now, we have
in the auditorium tonight...

1129
02:25:05,812 --> 02:25:07,439
a surprise guest.

1130
02:25:08,248 --> 02:25:10,443
The real-life hero of this story.

1131
02:25:10,850 --> 02:25:13,284
The man who hunted down
the mighty Kong!

1132
02:25:14,954 --> 02:25:19,721
The man who risked all to win
the freedom of a helpless female.

1133
02:25:20,894 --> 02:25:23,226
A big hand for Mr. Bruce Baxter!

1134
02:25:29,102 --> 02:25:31,161
Thank you. Thank you.

1135
02:25:31,838 --> 02:25:32,998
Thank you.

1136
02:26:00,700 --> 02:26:02,133
He was right.

1137
02:26:03,703 --> 02:26:06,501
About there still being some
mystery left in this world...

1138
02:26:07,674 --> 02:26:09,972
and we can all have
a piece of it...

1139
02:26:10,343 --> 02:26:12,607
for the price
of an admission ticket.

1140
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:16,478
That's the thing you come
to learn about Carl.

1141
02:26:18,585 --> 02:26:21,986
His unfailing ability to
destroy the things he loves.

1142
02:26:36,436 --> 02:26:39,030
Please remain calm,
ladies and gentlemen...

1143
02:26:39,105 --> 02:26:42,404
for we now come to the
climax of this savage ritual.

1144
02:26:42,609 --> 02:26:45,100
The sacrifice
of a beautiful young girl.

1145
02:26:45,879 --> 02:26:49,508
Behold her terror as she is
offered up to the mighty Kong!

1146
02:26:50,750 --> 02:26:54,811
A big hand, folks,
for the bravest girl I've ever met!

1147
02:26:55,555 --> 02:26:56,817
Miss Ann Darrow.

1148
02:27:44,804 --> 02:27:46,533
Save me from the beast!

1149
02:27:55,415 --> 02:27:56,643
Help me!

1150
02:28:00,787 --> 02:28:02,084
Where is she?

1151
02:28:03,256 --> 02:28:04,814
Where's Ann?
I have no idea.

1152
02:28:04,891 --> 02:28:08,292
I heard he offered her all kinds of
money and she turned him down flat.

1153
02:28:08,361 --> 02:28:13,060
<i>Pack up all my cares and woe</i>

1154
02:28:14,834 --> 02:28:16,267
<i>Here I go</i>

1155
02:28:17,604 --> 02:28:19,299
<i>Singing low</i>

1156
02:28:21,541 --> 02:28:23,566
<i>Bye bye</i>

1157
02:28:25,979 --> 02:28:27,378
<i>Blackbird</i>

1158
02:28:32,652 --> 02:28:36,952
<i>Where somebody waits for me</i>

1159
02:28:38,424 --> 02:28:40,016
<i>Sugar's sweet</i>

1160
02:28:41,461 --> 02:28:43,224
<i>So is he</i>

1161
02:28:45,565 --> 02:28:47,260
<i>Bye bye</i>

1162
02:28:49,402 --> 02:28:51,962
<i>Blackbird</i>

1163
02:28:54,107 --> 02:28:55,438
Here's your story, boys.

1164
02:28:55,508 --> 02:28:58,602
"Beauty and the man
who saved her from the beast."

1165
02:29:04,350 --> 02:29:05,339
No.

1166
02:29:13,693 --> 02:29:15,558
We have to get these people
out of here.

1167
02:29:15,628 --> 02:29:17,619
Everyone needs to leave, okay?
Come on.

1168
02:29:19,365 --> 02:29:21,560
Let him roar.
It makes a swell picture.

1169
02:29:23,403 --> 02:29:24,427
Head for the exits.

1170
02:29:24,504 --> 02:29:26,938
Get your own seat, buddy.
You're not having mine.

1171
02:29:35,114 --> 02:29:36,342
Excuse me, fellows.

1172
02:29:37,283 --> 02:29:39,979
Coming through.
Coming through, fellows.

1173
02:29:43,556 --> 02:29:46,548
Get me down! Help me, please!

1174
02:29:48,962 --> 02:29:51,863
Somebody! Somebody help me!

1175
02:29:55,268 --> 02:29:57,930
Go! Go! Get out!

1176
02:30:01,908 --> 02:30:03,398
Go! Go!

1177
02:31:38,404 --> 02:31:40,395
There they are.

1178
02:31:53,653 --> 02:31:55,314
Go! Wait for me!

1179
02:31:56,222 --> 02:31:57,587
Go back!

1180
02:32:04,597 --> 02:32:05,859
This way!

1181
02:32:13,639 --> 02:32:14,799
Help!

1182
02:32:23,216 --> 02:32:24,205
No!

1183
02:33:04,123 --> 02:33:06,785
Taxi! Follow that ape.

1184
02:33:06,859 --> 02:33:08,349
Come on, pal,
we gotta draw him off.

1185
02:33:08,427 --> 02:33:10,258
It's all yours, buddy.

1186
02:33:26,679 --> 02:33:28,408
Hey, get out of here, lady!

1187
02:33:49,135 --> 02:33:50,363
Come on.

1188
02:33:59,545 --> 02:34:00,534
Buddy!

1189
02:34:01,881 --> 02:34:04,111
Come on. Come on.

1190
02:34:17,496 --> 02:34:18,485
Look out.

1191
02:34:41,153 --> 02:34:42,381
Jesus Christ.

1192
02:40:05,945 --> 02:40:07,037
Fire!

1193
02:40:09,448 --> 02:40:10,540
Stop!

1194
02:40:36,609 --> 02:40:38,167
No. No.

1195
02:43:09,728 --> 02:43:11,059
Beautiful.

1196
02:43:17,503 --> 02:43:18,561
Yes.

1197
02:43:21,206 --> 02:43:22,571
Yes, it is.

1198
02:48:19,104 --> 02:48:20,230
Hey! Hey!

1199
02:48:20,505 --> 02:48:22,132
Nobody past this point.

1200
02:48:23,375 --> 02:48:25,002
You can't go in there!

1201
02:48:26,344 --> 02:48:27,333
Hey!

1202
02:48:29,448 --> 02:48:30,745
Stop him!

1203
02:48:33,852 --> 02:48:36,116
Hey! Get back.
You're not allowed up there!

1204
02:48:36,188 --> 02:48:37,849
What's going on? Go!

1205
02:52:19,744 --> 02:52:21,041
No!

1206
02:52:22,213 --> 02:52:24,374
No!

1207
02:52:31,356 --> 02:52:33,984
Please! No!

1208
02:52:34,359 --> 02:52:35,553
No!

1209
02:55:32,170 --> 02:55:34,468
Ann. Ann.

1210
02:56:23,788 --> 02:56:25,085
Move along.

1211
02:56:25,557 --> 02:56:27,457
Just one shot! One shot!

1212
02:56:28,126 --> 02:56:30,219
Come, come!
Boys, how about a photo?

1213
02:56:30,295 --> 02:56:31,284
Look at me.

1214
02:56:31,396 --> 02:56:33,125
Come on, watch the camera.

1215
02:56:35,967 --> 02:56:37,491
Come a little closer.

1216
02:56:38,169 --> 02:56:40,364
That's it, folks.
Show's over. Step back!

1217
02:56:40,438 --> 02:56:42,633
Clear the area. That's it.
Shove off, boys.

1218
02:56:43,341 --> 02:56:44,899
Why'd he do that?

1219
02:56:45,209 --> 02:56:47,677
Climb up there
and get himself cornered.

1220
02:56:47,745 --> 02:56:50,077
The ape must have known
what was coming.

1221
02:56:50,148 --> 02:56:52,810
He's just a dumb animal.
Didn't know nothing.

1222
02:56:59,023 --> 02:57:01,753
What does it matter?
Airplanes got him.

1223
02:57:04,329 --> 02:57:06,297
It wasn't the airplanes.

1224
02:57:10,668 --> 02:57:12,966
It was beauty killed the beast.
