{"0 - 16.77": "live from New York where business never  sleeps this is squawk box look like  squawk box this morning the Federal  Communications Commission considering  breaking the grip of cable and satellite  companies that they have over TV set-top  boxes TiVo supports this idea saying  more competition would benefit the  consumer by not only lowering cost but  also boosting functionality bringing all  streaming and video services into one  device joining us right now to unveil  his company's latest device is TiVo's  president and CEO Tom Rogers and an old  friend of NBC and CNBC the founding  where do we describe you as the founding  executive of CNBC these days I guess  that's fair I don't think I've been at  CNBC this early since we turned it on  the first day 26 years ago but it's  great to be here congratulations on on  new box explain to us what this new box  does because one of the things that's  you know we talk like we talk about  Apple TV all the time and what that is  gonna do but this box from all the  reviews people think this is like the  second coming of the golden age of  television there are so many things  TiVo bolt does that Apple TV does not do  what TiVo bolts all about is speed  getting you to and through your  programming as fast as you possibly can  we have a new thing called skip mode  which perfects fast forward essentially  you get to a commercial pod click the  button takes you entirely through the  commercial pod whether it's three four  minutes it just gets you right to the  next this is not holding the button you  don't have to deal with what we call  commercial over sewage or premature  plays where you're trying to big problem  in every household this you have you  have partnerships with content providers  we do don't they hate you no no not at  all remember what we do with TiVo bolt  it's a unified entertainment system so  many people are abandoning free  over-the-air television and cable  channels why because they don't like  commercial breaks and what this does is  give people control  to be able to say you know what I can  stay with my traditional TV I can stay  with linear television we know with DVR  behavior people still watch a lot of  commercials even though they have the  ability to fast-forward we know even  with this they'll still get a lot of  commercials coming through that's a  whole lot better way in terms of holding  people to traditional TV than them  abandon it altogether for streaming  services that have no ads at all when I  watch them that with the ad the ads it's  when I forget to fast-forward I forget  that I it happens all the time how do  how do you think of an Apple TV because  in part because that's what people talk  about is sort of the next they that's  what we talk about is next coming of the  way we're gonna be watching television  in truth well you know when Apple TV  gets you Netflix and Amazon and Hulu  TiVo does that but what Apple TV doesn't  do is bring you the entire world of  traditional channels video on-demand and  putting it all together into a single  way they talked about Universal Search  to me what that is is if you define the  universe's Venus Mars and Pluto then  it's Universal search they don't have  the entirety of your television world to  be able to search across we do that  moreover with Apple TV you can't get rid  of your cable box you can get rid of  your cable box put in TiVo bolt put in  some TiVo minis for additional sets save  yourself 40 or 50 dollars a month in  terms of equipment charges from the  average cable operator imposes and you  get great cable service you get the  streaming world you put it all together  save money and the key to TiVo both is  saving time isn't it isn't there big  upfront cost I mean you look at an apple  and I I accept that it may not do all  the same things an Apple box the new  ones gonna cost what about 150 bucks  something like that this is your price  points are $300 there's one that's the  closer to 400 ollars right well the  price point for this is $2.99 it  includes your annual subscription fee up  front all included and remember compare  that against what you're able to get rid  of the amount of money you can save on  your cable bill when you bring that in  and own your equipment not to mention a  vastly better experience  but what what both is really all about  is saving you incredible amount of time  we have two modes not only the skip mode  for commercial breaks but something  called quick mode that allows you to  watch any program that you've recorded  30% faster with pitch-perfect audio so  for those not award shows stops matches  a new content providers get paid then  because I do like having a paycheck I  don't like commercials so it's it's this  weird internal quandary where I'm like  I'm skipping forward but yet I also need  to and want to get paid well first of  all it's not going to affect news  channels or sports channels this is 20  channels with primetime entertainment  which is really where the frustration  that varies to create that content as I  said what is happening the the biggest  issue facing the traditional media  industry are people abandoning viewing  and finding streaming services that have  no ads at all we know people fast  forward but they get frustrated and if  we can give them away that gives them  the ability to have control they're  gonna stay with linear television look  what happened when the original DVR and  fast-forward he came about the media  industry adapted with measurements III  c7 the world didn't didn't didn't go  away what is happening now is they are  actually abandoning commercial  television and fleeing to add free TV  and streaming services we think this  will hold them to the linear channel  because the the the the issue of  premature plays will not be the one that  that frustrates them Tom Rogers thank  you for coming in this morning thanks  for having me my fantasy football team  premature playing I'm excited about this  new TiVo well NFL is now on on Apple TV  99 bucks a year the NFL game pass you  can watch it the minute the game is over  can you watch it on TV in a 30 you can  watch any football game you want to on"}
